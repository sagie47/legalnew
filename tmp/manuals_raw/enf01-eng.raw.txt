Updates to chapter 
 
Listing by date: 
 
 
2013-09-04 
Sections 3 and 5 have been updated and Section 7.3 has been added, to reflect 
changes made to the security inadmissibility and ministerial relief provisions that have 
come into force following the Royal Assent of the Faster Removal of Foreign Criminals 
Act. The provision on espionage has been amended. The provision on subversion 
against any democratic government, institution or process has been established under a 
new paragraph, namely A34(1)(b.1). Ministerial relief provisions under subsections 
A34(2), A35(2) and A37(2) have been repealed and replaced by section A42.1. 
 
 
2008-08-08 
Changes were made to ENF 1 at 7.11 to correctly reflect the legislation. 
 
 
2006-07-13 
Changes were made to chapter ENF 1 to remove references to “omissions” in the 
context of criminal inadmissibility. The term, which was contained in the provisions of 
the former Act, is not contained in the IRPA.   
 
 
2005-06-27 
Changes were made to chapter ENF 1 in order to reflect the CIC and CBSA policy 
responsibility and service delivery roles. 
 
Caselaw was added in Appendix A for cases involving A37(1)(a) and A40. 
 
 
2003-11-25 
Minor changes were made to chapter ENF 1, entitled Inadmissibility. Section 7.18 and 
Section 7.19 — Security Review changed to Organized Crime Directorate. 
 
 
2003-07-16 
Both minor and substantive changes and clarifications have been made throughout 
ENF 1 - Inadmissibility. It is recommended that any former version of this chapter be 
discarded in favour of the one now appearing in CIC Explore. 
 
 
2003-03-04 
Section 7.19 has been amended to reflect that the Minister’s representative does not 
have to prove that the organization is involved in criminal activity (A37(1)(b)).

1. 
What this chapter is about 
This chapter: 
 
details the particular inadmissibility provisions of the Immigration and Refugee 
Protection Act (IRPA or the Act) (Division 4 of Part 1); and 
 
provides functional direction and guidance in applying the inadmissibility provisions 
by giving an analysis of each allegation’s case elements, examples of 
recommended evidence and, in some cases, a summary of jurisprudence. 
2. 
Program objectives 
The objectives of the Canadian immigration legislation relative to the inadmissibility 
provisions are: 
 
to protect the health and safety of Canadians and to maintain the security of 
Canadian society; 
 
to promote international justice and security by fostering respect for human rights 
and by denying access to Canadian territory to persons who are criminals or 
security risks; and 
 
to ensure that decisions taken under the Act are consistent with the Canadian 
Charter of Rights and Freedoms, including its principles of equality and freedom 
from discrimination and of the equality of English and French as the official 
languages of Canada. 
In dealings with persons who may be inadmissible to Canada, officers control the 
admission and/or allow for the presence of persons in Canada by referencing the 
various inadmissibility provisions of the IRPA.  
Part 1, Division 4 of the Act makes distinctions based on categories of inadmissibility 
related to: 
 
criminality; 
 
organized criminality; 
 
security; 
 
human or international rights violations; 
 
health; 
 
financial reasons; 
 
misrepresentation; 
 
non-compliance; 
 
inadmissible family members.

Notes 
“reasonable grounds” means more than mere suspicion but less than the civil test of 
balance of probabilities. It is a much lower threshold than the criminal standard of 
“beyond a reasonable doubt.” It is a bona fide belief in a serious possibility based on 
credible evidence. 
 
“espionage” is the practice of spying; that is, the gathering of information in a 
surreptitious manner; secretly seeking out information usually from a hostile country to 
benefit one’s own country. 
A80: If an A77(1) certificate is determined to be reasonable under A80, it is conclusive 
proof that the permanent resident or the foreign national named in it is inadmissible; it is

Notes 
“reasonable grounds” means more than mere suspicion but less than the civil test of 
balance of probabilities. It is a much lower threshold than the criminal standard of 
“beyond a reasonable doubt.” It is a bona fide belief in a serious possibility based on 
credible evidence. 
“espionage” is the practice of spying; that is, the gathering of information in a 
surreptitious manner; secretly seeking out information usually from a hostile country to 
benefit one’s own. 
“subversion” is accomplishing change by illicit means or for improper purposes related 
to an organization; overturning or overthrowing.

Notes 
“reasonable grounds” means more than mere suspicion but less than the civil test of 
balance of probabilities. It is a much lower threshold than the criminal standard of 
“beyond a reasonable doubt.” It is a bona fide belief in a serious possibility based on 
credible evidence. 
Governments or regimes that, in the opinion of the Minister of PSEP, are or were 
engaged in systematic or gross human rights violations or war crimes or crimes against 
humanity are listed in ENF 18, War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity.  
“terrorism” relates to activities directed toward or in support of the threat or use of acts 
of violence against persons or property for the purposes of achieving a political 
objective; an act intended to cause death or serious bodily injury to a civilian, or to any 
other person not taking an active part in hostilities in a situation of armed conflict, when 
the purpose of such act, by its nature or context, is to intimidate a population or to 
compel a government or an international organization to do or to abstain from doing any 
act. (See jurisprudence relating to "Baroud" and “Suresh” in Appendix A). 
There is no rebuttable presumption for those positions listed in the Regulations. All 
other senior government positions carry a rebuttable presumption such that the 
applicant is deemed inadmissible unless they can satisfy the Minister of PSEP that their 
presence is not detrimental to national interest. 
A80: If an A77(1) certificate is determined to be reasonable under A80, it is conclusive 
proof that the permanent resident or the foreign national named in it is inadmissible; it is 
a removal order that may not be appealed against and that is in force without the 
necessity of holding or continuing an examination or an admissibility hearing.

persons who are inadmissible solely on the grounds of A35(1)(c). 
A64(1): No appeal may be made to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) by a foreign 
national or their sponsor or by a permanent resident if the foreign national or permanent 
resident has been found to be inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or 
international rights, serious criminality or organized criminality.

Notes 
“balance of probabilities” is the civil standard of proof used in administrative tribunals, 
unless otherwise specified. It means that the evidence presented must show that the 
facts as alleged are more probable than not. Accordingly, a party having the burden of 
proof by a “balance of probabilities” must be able to persuade, by the evidence, that a 
claim or a fact is more probably true than not true. The evidence presented favours or 
outweighs opposing evidence. It is a higher standard of proof than “reasonable grounds

in criminal proceedings. 
The residency obligation in the Act is based on a period of physical presence in Canada 
with provisions for prolonged absences from Canada (three years out of every five-year 
period for any reason). In certain circumstances, permanent residents including 
accompanying family members, are allowed even longer absences when they are 
employed abroad. Humanitarian and compassionate considerations, including the best 
interests of a child, will be taken into account in all residency obligation status 
determinations and, when justified, will overcome any breach of those obligations that 
may have occurred prior to the determination (A28(2)(c)). 
R228(2): For the purposes of subsection A44(2), if the Minister’s delegate makes a 
removal order against a permanent resident who fails to comply with the residency 
obligation under A28, the order shall be a departure order. 
Relevant Provisions of the Act: 
A44(3):  An officer or the Immigration Division may impose any conditions, including the 
payment of a deposit or the posting of a guarantee for compliance with the conditions 
that the officer or the Division considers necessary on a permanent resident or a foreign 
national who is the subject of a report, an admissibility hearing or, being in Canada, a 
removal order. 
A27(2): A permanent resident must comply with any conditions imposed under the 
regulations. 
A28(1): A permanent resident must comply with a residency obligation with respect to 
every five- year period. 
A28(2): The following provisions govern the residency obligation under subsection 
A28(1): 
(a)  a permanent resident complies with the residency obligation with respect to a five-
year period if, on each of a total or at least 730 days in that five-year period, they are: 
(i)  physically present in Canada, 
(ii)  outside Canada accompanying a Canadian citizen who is their spouse or 
common-law partner or, in the case of a child, their parent,

CIC has the policy responsibility with respect to inadmissible family members 
[A42]. 
 
A42(a)    
42. A foreign national, other than a protected person, is inadmissible on grounds of an 
inadmissible family member if 
(a) their accompanying family member or, in prescribed circumstances, their non- 
accompanying family member is inadmissible. 
 
Exception 
A protected person within the meaning of subsection A95(2). 
 
Case elements: 
balance of probabilities 
foreign national (other than a protected person) 
entering Canada 
their accompanying family member or non-accompanying family member (in prescribed 
circumstances) is inadmissible 
For information about recommended evidence and how to obtain it, see Obtaining 
evidence for A42(a), Section 7.28, below. 
 
Notes 
“balance of probabilities” is the civil standard of proof used in administrative tribunals, 
unless otherwise specified. It means that the evidence presented must show that the 
facts as alleged are more probable than not. Accordingly, a party having the burden of 
proof by a “balance of probabilities” must be able to persuade, by the evidence, that a 
claim or a fact is more probably true than not true. The evidence presented favours or 
outweighs opposing evidence. It is a higher standard of proof than “reasonable grounds 
to believe,” but is lower than the criminal standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt” used 
in criminal proceedings. 
Under the provisions of A42, foreign nationals may be found inadmissible if their 
accompanying family member or, in circumstances prescribed by Regulations, a family 
member who does not accompany them is inadmissible. Further, they may be found to 
be inadmissible themselves if they accompany an inadmissible family member. 
The person concerned must be “of the family” or “a family member”; in the absence of 
this, the allegation is unsupportable. 
Referral of a report to the Immigration Division; Removal Order - See R228(1)(d): 
For the purposes of subsection A44(2), and subject to R228(3), if a report in respect of 
a foreign national does not include any grounds of inadmissibility other than those set 
out in the circumstances described under R228(1) (Note: includes section A42), then 
the Minister’s delegate shall not refer the report to the Immigration Division; 
and 
if the Minister’s delegate makes a removal order against the foreign national, the 
Minister’s delegate shall make the same removal order as was made in respect of the 
inadmissible family member.

Instruments and delegations 
The Designation of Officers and Delegation of Authority documents for the various 
admissibility sections of the Act have been described in more detail in ENF2/OP18. 
Please refer to the Designation of Officers and Delegation of Authority documents in IL3 
for more details.

Departmental policy 
Division 4 of Part 1 of the IRPA contains the core provisions relating to inadmissibility; 
that is to say, most provisions relating to inadmissibility are contained in the Act. 
The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration (C&I) is responsible for the administration 
of IRPA, with the exception of the areas for which the Minister of Public Safety and 
Emergency Preparedness (PSEP) has responsibility as described below. 
The Minister of PSEP is responsible for the administration of the IRPA as it relates to: 
 the examination at ports of entry; 
 the enforcement of the Act, including arrest, detention and removal; 
 Designation under A20.1(1) 
 the establishment of policies respecting the enforcement of the Act and 
inadmissibility on grounds of security, organized criminality or violating human 
or international rights; or 
 declarations under A42.1(1) and A42.1(2).  
Section A43 authorizes the making of regulations to provide for matters relating to 
inadmissibility and to define circumstances in which a class of permanent residents or 
foreign nationals is exempted from any of the inadmissibility provisions. 
The use of regulations allows the government to introduce a greater degree of 
transparency. In most cases, persons not covered by the regulations may still be 
considered described or eligible for a specific relief provision after an assessment of the 
individual evidence. In this way, the regulations and schedules are not exhaustive but 
will address the most straightforward cases. 
The purpose of regulations is to more objectively define criteria for specified allegations. 
The aim is to increase the objective factor and reduce the subjective factor in the 
decision-making process through greater codification in the regulations where possible. 
With improved definition, greater transparency is introduced and outcomes or decisions 
become more predictable for some cases. 
Reliance on regulations and schedules provides maximum flexibility and retains the 
government’s capacity to respond quickly to environmental or policy shifts. 
The Act groups regulation-making authority with the sections of the Act to which the 
regulations will be applicable. This makes it clearer, when reading the Act, where 
regulatory authority comes from, as well as its scope, limits and application. 
The Act requires the Ministers to table any proposed regulations respecting 
examinations, rights and obligations of permanent and temporary residents, loss of 
status and removal, detention and release, refugee eligibility, the pre-removal risk 
assessment, transportation companies and information-sharing before each House of 
Parliament for referral to the appropriate Committee of that House. This will allow the 
Standing Committees to provide input into regulations and will strengthen citizens’

capacity to play an active role in shaping regulations through an open and transparent 
regulatory process.

 
proof of conviction: This is preferable and should be introduced into evidence at an 
admissibility hearing so that it forms part of the record, even if the person 
concerned concedes the allegation. Such proof consists of a certified copy of the 
Conviction Certificate or the Warrant of Committal. A certified copy of the court 
information containing the accusations against the person concerned and indicating 
a conviction may also be used; 
 
text of the Canadian statute to prove that the offence is punishable by a term of 
imprisonment of at least ten years or proof that a term of imprisonment of more than 
six months was imposed, whichever is applicable; 
 
statutory declaration – evidence of statements made to an officer; 
 
statutory declaration including documentary evidence, testimony from witnesses, or 
an admission by the person him/herself establishing that the person concerned has 
been convicted of an offence in Canada. If a person is not contesting a criminality 
allegation, then the person's admission of such criminality, which may take the form 
of a statutory declaration, can also constitute sufficient evidence. In-Canada 
convictions may be confirmed through the Canadian Police Information Centre 
(CPIC). See ENF 13, CPIC and Interpol Procedures for CIC.  
Note: Testimony and/or declarations of the person concerned or witnesses: This method of 
establishing inadmissibility, when used in the absence of documentary evidence, is the least

7.12. 
Obtaining evidence and determining equivalency for A36(1)(b) 
The officer may obtain evidence for A36(1)(b) by collecting: 


===== PAGE 39 =====
ENF 1 Inadmissibility 
 2013-09-04 
 
39 
 
proof of conviction: This is preferable and should be introduced into evidence at the 
admissibility hearing even if the person concerned concedes the allegation. Such 
proof includes conviction certificates, warrants of committal, appropriately noted 
information or indictment (bill of indictment), or a telexed, e-mailed or telephoned 
statement from the appropriate foreign authorities confirming that the relevant 
records indicate a conviction. If confirmation of conviction is received by telephone, 
the receiving officer should complete a statutory declaration attesting to that fact; 
 
factual background that led to the conviction(s). This evidence may be obtained 
from the courts, the police authorities in the foreign country, or the person 
concerned; 
 
statutory declaration - evidence of statements made to an officer; 
 
statutory declaration including documentary evidence, testimony from witnesses, or 
an admission by the person him/herself establishing that the person concerned has 
been convicted of an offence outside Canada. If a person is not contesting a 
criminality allegation, then the person's admission of such criminality which may 
take the form of a statutory declaration can also constitute sufficient evidence. 
Convictions in the United States of America may be confirmed through the 
Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC). See AD 13, CPIC and Interpol 
Procedures for CIC; 
Note: Testimony and/or declarations of the person concerned or witnesses: This method of 
establishing inadmissibility, when used in the absence of documentary evidence, is the least 
desirable as the person concerned may be unable to recite the details of the conviction. 
 
the text of the foreign offence and the text of the equivalent Canadian offence. This 
evidence is required to establish equivalence. With respect to the foreign offence, a 
photocopy of the relevant provision of the foreign law is sufficient. This may be 
obtained from law libraries, embassies, or consulates. The texts must be introduced 
into evidence at the admissibility hearing so that they will form part of the official 
record. It is recognized that not all countries codify their criminal laws in a text of 
statutes as is done in Canada. In such cases, officers should use their best efforts 
to obtain a legal description of the foreign offence. Such descriptions may be 
obtained from foreign jurisprudence in law libraries or from embassies or 
consulates. In the absence of such a description, evidence of the facts that led to 
the conviction may be sufficient to support a finding that the person is described; 
 
in preparation for the admissibility hearing, evidence should be obtained showing 
that the person concerned has not satisfied the Minister of C&I that they have 
rehabilitated themselves. Although the person concerned has the onus of proving 
that the Minister of C&I has approved of their rehabilitation, the officer should 
nevertheless confirm whether such approval has been issued in order to ascertain 
whether the referral for a hearing should be withdrawn or to counter possible 
testimony by the person him/herself that rehabilitation approval was issued; 
 
other documentary evidence including, but not limited to, media articles, scholarly 
journals, expert evidence (i.e., evidence from a person who is a specialist in a 
subject and who may present an “expert” opinion). 
Equivalency can be determined three ways: 
 
by comparison of the precise wording in each statute both through documents and, 
if available, through the evidence of an expert or experts in the foreign law with a 
view to determining the essential ingredients of the respective offences; 
 
by examining the evidence adduced before the member of the Immigration Division, 
both oral and documentary, to ascertain whether or not that evidence was sufficient 
to establish that the essential ingredients of the offence in Canada had been proven

in the foreign proceedings, whether precisely described in the initiating documents 
or in the statutory provisions in the same words or not; or 
 
by a combination of the two. 
7.13. 
Obtaining evidence and determining equivalency for A36(1)(c) 
The officer may obtain evidence for A36(1)(c) by collecting: 
 
statutory declaration -  evidence of statements made to an officer; 
 
statutory declaration including documentary evidence, testimony from witnesses, or 
an admission by the person him/herself establishing that the person concerned has 
committed an act outside Canada that is an offence in the place where it was 
committed. If a person is not contesting a criminality allegation, then the person's 
admission of such criminality, which may take the form of a statutory declaration, 
can also constitute sufficient evidence; 
Note: Testimony and/or declarations of the person concerned or witnesses: This method of 
establishing inadmissibility, when used in the absence of documentary evidence, is the least 
desirable as the person concerned may be unable to recite the details of the offence. 
 
evidence that constitutes “a balance of probabilities” that the person concerned 
committed a prohibited act outside Canada. Evidence may consist of security or 
police reports, court records, newspaper clippings, or statutory declarations from 
foreign authorities that demonstrate that an offence has been committed; that an 
arrest warrant is outstanding; that charges are pending; and/or that the person has 
been indicted; 
 
the text of the foreign legislation and the text of the Canadian legislation to establish 
equivalence and to prove that the offence is punishable under an Act of Parliament 
by way of indictment for a maximum term of imprisonment of at least ten years. 
With respect to the foreign offence, a photocopy of the relevant provision of the 
foreign law is sufficient. This may be obtained from law libraries, embassies, or 
consulates. The texts must be introduced into evidence at the admissibility hearing 
so that they will form part of the official record. It is recognized that not all countries 
codify their criminal laws in a text of statutes as is done in Canada. In such cases,

that the Minister of C&I has approved of their rehabilitation, the officer should 
nevertheless confirm whether such approval has been issued in order to ascertain 
whether the referral for a hearing should be withdrawn or to counter possible 
testimony by the person him/herself that rehabilitation approval was issued; 
 
other documentary evidence including, but not limited to, media articles, scholarly 
journals, expert evidence (i.e., evidence from a person who is a specialist in a 
subject and who may present an “expert” opinion). 
Equivalency can be determined three ways: 
 
by comparison of the precise wording in each statute both through documents and, 
if available, through the evidence of an expert or experts in the foreign law with a

 
by examining the evidence adduced before the member of the Immigration Division, 
both oral and documentary, to ascertain whether or not that evidence was sufficient 
to establish that the essential ingredients of the offence in Canada had been proven

 
by a combination of the two. 
7.14. 
Obtaining evidence for A36(2)(a) 
The officer may obtain evidence for A36(2)(a) by collecting: 
 
proof of conviction: This is preferable and should be introduced into evidence so 
that it forms part of the record even if the person concerned concedes the 
allegation. Such proof consists of a certified copy of the conviction certificate or the 
warrant of committal. A certified copy of the court information containing the 
accusations against the person concerned and indicating a conviction may also be 
used; 
 
text of the Canadian statute setting out the indictable offence or summary 
convictions of which the person concerned has been convicted; 
 
statutory declaration - evidence of statements made to an officer; 
 
statutory declaration including documentary evidence, testimony from witnesses, or 
an admission by the person him/herself establishing that the person concerned has 
been convicted of an offence or offences in Canada. If a person is not contesting a 
criminality allegation, then the person's admission of such criminality which may 
take the form of a statutory declaration can also constitute sufficient evidence. In-
Canada convictions may be confirmed through the Canadian Police Information 
Centre (CPIC). See AD 13 CPIC and Interpol Procedures for CIC; 
Note: Testimony and/or declarations of the person concerned or witnesses: This method of 
establishing inadmissibility, when used in the absence of documentary evidence, is the least 
desirable as the person concerned may be unable to recite the details of the conviction. 
 
evidence that the convictions did not arise from the same occurrence (if applicable). 
This evidence can usually be found in court or police documents setting out the 
factual background of the offence, such as the court information or the police 
reports; 
 
evidence, where relevant, that the person concerned is not a Canadian citizen or a 
permanent resident. To establish that the person concerned is not a Canadian 
citizen, an admission by the person directly or documented through a statutory 
declaration is considered sufficient evidence. A letter from CPC Sydney stating that 
there is no record that the person concerned is a citizen of Canada is also sufficient. 
To establish that the person concerned is not a permanent resident of Canada, an 
admission by the person directly or documented through a statutory declaration is 
considered sufficient evidence. A Query Response Centre (QRC), CIC, document 
indicating no confirmation of permanent residence is also sufficient. 
7.15. 
Obtaining evidence and determining equivalency for A36(2)(b) 
The officer may obtain evidence for A36(2)(b) by collecting: 
 
proof of conviction: This is preferable and should be introduced into evidence at the 
admissibility hearing even if the person concerned concedes the allegation. Such 
proof includes conviction certificates, warrants of committal, appropriately noted 
information or indictment (bill of indictment), or a telexed, e-mailed or telephoned 
statement from the appropriate foreign authorities confirming that the relevant 


===== PAGE 42 =====

records indicate a conviction. If confirmation of conviction is received by telephone, 
the receiving officer should complete a statutory declaration attesting to that fact; 
 
factual background that led to the conviction(s). This evidence may be obtained 
from the courts, the police authorities in the foreign country, or the person 
concerned; 
 
statutory declaration - evidence of statements made to an officer; 
 
statutory declaration including documentary evidence, testimony from witnesses, or 
an admission by the person him/herself establishing that the person concerned has 
been convicted of an offence or offences outside Canada. If a person is not 
contesting a criminality allegation, then the person's admission of such criminality 
which may take the form of a statutory declaration can also constitute sufficient 
evidence. Convictions in the United States of America may be confirmed through 
the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC). See AD 13, CPIC and Interpol 
Procedures for CIC; 
Note: Testimony and/or declarations of the person concerned or witnesses: This method of 
establishing inadmissibility, when used in the absence of documentary evidence, is the least 
desirable as the person concerned may be unable to recite the details of the conviction. 
 
the text of the foreign legislation and the text of the Canadian legislation to establish 
equivalence. With respect to the foreign offence, a photocopy of the relevant 
provision of the foreign law is sufficient. This may be obtained from law libraries, 
embassies, or consulates. The texts must be introduced into evidence at the 
admissibility hearing so that they will form part of the official record. It is recognized 
that not all countries codify their criminal laws in a text of statutes as is done in 
Canada. In such cases, officers should use their best efforts to obtain a legal 
description of the foreign offence. Such descriptions may be obtained from foreign 
jurisprudence in law libraries or from embassies or consulates. In the absence of 
such a description, evidence of the facts that led to the conviction may be sufficient 
to support a finding that the person is described; 
 
evidence that the convictions did not arise from the same occurrence (if applicable). 
This evidence can usually be found in court or police documents setting out the 
factual background of the offence, such as the court information or the police 
reports; 
 
evidence, where relevant, that the person concerned is not a Canadian citizen or a 
permanent resident. To establish that the person concerned is not a Canadian 
citizen, an admission by the person directly or documented through a statutory 
declaration is considered sufficient evidence. A letter from CPC Sydney stating that 
there is no record that the person concerned is a citizen of Canada is also sufficient. 
To establish that the person concerned is not a permanent resident of Canada, an 
admission by the person directly or documented through a statutory declaration is 
considered sufficient evidence. A Query Response Centre (QRC), CIC, document 
indicating no confirmation of permanent residence is also sufficient; 
 
other documentary evidence including, but not limited to, media articles, scholarly 
journals, expert evidence (i.e., evidence from a person who is a specialist in a 
subject and who may present an “expert” opinion). 
Equivalency can be determined three ways: 
 
by comparison of the precise wording in each statute both through documents and, 
if available, through the evidence of an expert or experts in the foreign law with a 
view to determining the essential ingredients of the respective offences; 


===== PAGE 43 =====
ENF 1 Inadmissibility 
 2013-09-04 
 
43 
 
by examining the evidence adduced before the member of the Immigration Division, 
both oral and documentary, to ascertain whether or not that evidence was sufficient 
to establish that the essential ingredients of the offence in Canada had been proven 
in the foreign proceedings, whether precisely described in the initiating documents 
or in the statutory provisions in the same words or not; or 
 
by a combination of the two. 
7.16. 
Obtaining evidence and determining equivalency for A36(2)(c) 
The officer may obtain evidence for A36(2)(c) by collecting: 
 
statutory declaration -  evidence of statements made to an officer; 
 
statutory declaration including documentary evidence, testimony from witnesses, or 
an admission by the person him/herself establishing that the person concerned has 
committed an act outside Canada that is an offence in the place where it was 
committed. If a person is not contesting a criminality allegation, then the person's 
admission of such criminality which may take the form of a statutory declaration can 
also constitute sufficient evidence; 
Note: Testimony and/or declarations of the person concerned or witnesses: This method of 
establishing inadmissibility, when used in the absence of documentary evidence, is the least 
desirable as the person concerned may be unable to recite the details of the offence. 
 
evidence that constitutes “reasonable grounds” that the person concerned 
committed prohibited act(s) outside Canada. Evidence may consist of security or 
police reports, court records, newspaper clippings, or statutory declarations from 
foreign authorities that demonstrate that an offence has been committed, and that 
an arrest warrant is outstanding, that charges are pending and/or that the person 
has been indicted; 
 
the text of the foreign legislation and the text of the Canadian legislation to establish 
equivalence. With respect to the foreign offence, a photocopy of the relevant 
provision of the foreign law is sufficient. This may be obtained from law libraries, 
embassies, or consulates. The texts must be introduced into evidence at the 
admissibility hearing so that they will form part of the official record. It is recognized 
that not all countries codify their criminal laws in a text of statutes as is done in 
Canada. In such cases, officers should use their best efforts to obtain a legal 
description of the foreign offence. Such descriptions may be obtained from foreign 
jurisprudence in law libraries or from embassies or consulates. In the absence of 
such a description, evidence of the facts that led to the conviction may be sufficient 
to support a finding that the person is described; 
 
in preparation for the admissibility hearing, evidence should be obtained showing 
that the person concerned has not satisfied the Minister of C&I that they have 
rehabilitated themselves. Although the person concerned has the onus of proving 
that the Minister of C&I has approved of their rehabilitation, the officer should 
nevertheless confirm whether such approval has been issued in order to ascertain 
whether the referral for a hearing should be withdrawn or to counter possible 
testimony by the person him/herself that rehabilitation approval was issued; 
 
evidence, where relevant, that the person concerned is not a Canadian citizen or a 
permanent resident. To establish that the person concerned is not a Canadian 
citizen, an admission by the person directly or documented through a statutory 
declaration is considered sufficient evidence. A letter from CPC Sydney stating that 
there is no record that the person concerned is a citizen of Canada is also sufficient. 
To establish that the person concerned is not a permanent resident of Canada, an 
admission by the person directly or documented through a statutory declaration is

Appendix 
 A  Some notable inadmissibility jurisprudence 
Department of Justice Regional Office or Departmental Legal Services counsel will be 
able to assist hearings officers regarding the provision of applicable and updated 
jurisprudence. 
A34(1)(a), (b), (b.1), (c), (d), (e) and (f) 
Jurisprudence 
Baroud, Re (1995), 98 F.T.R. 99 (Fed. T.D.) 
 
“Terrorism” must receive an unrestrictive interpretation in order to prevent the arrival 
of persons considered to be a danger to Canadian society. 
Canada (Attorney General) v. Jolly, [1975] F.C. 216, 54 D.L.R. (3d) 277, 7 N.R. 271 
(Fed.C.A.) 
 
The question is not will the applicant engage in espionage or subversion or 
terrorism, but whether there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person 
will so behave. Even if evidence is given negating this fact, it is only necessary for 
the Minister to show the existence of reasonable grounds for believing the fact. It is 
not necessary for the Minister to go further in establishing the subversive character 
of the persons subject to the proceeding. 
Kashmiri v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1996), 37 C.R.R. (2d) 
264, 116 F.T.R. 316 (Fed. T.D.) 
 
If found inadmissible on security grounds, the onus to satisfy the Minister that their 
presence in Canada would not be detrimental to the national interest lies on the 
applicant. 
Qu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000), 5 Imm. L.R. (3d) 129 
(Fed. T.D.) 
 
“Subversion” and “espionage” are defined and addressed. 
Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000), 5 Imm. L.R. (3d) 1, 
183 D.L.R. (4th) 629, 18 Admin. L.R. (3d) 159, 252 N.R. 1 (Fed. C.A.), [2002] S.C.C. 1 
 
Denying entry to Convention refugees on security grounds is a violation of s. 7 of 
the Charter, BUT is saved by s. 1. 
 
Denying entry to Convention refugees on security grounds is not a violation of the 
Convention Against Torture, Covenant on Civil and Political Rights or the 
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees.  
 
It is permissible for a state to rid itself of those who pose a security risk without 
being in breach of its international obligations. 
Yamani v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (March 14, 2000), Doc. 
IMM-1919-98 (Fed. T.D.) 
 
The term “subversion” was found to violate s. 7 of the Charter by being too vague 
constitutionally but the judge then found that s. 1 of the Charter could be used to 
save the provision so that, in the final analysis, this term was found to be 
constitutional. 
Yamani v. Canada (Solicitor General) (1995), 31 Imm. L.R. (2d) 191, 129 D.L.R. (4th) 
226, 32 C.R.R. (2d) 295, 103 F.T.R. 105, [1996] 1 F.C. 174 (Fed. T.D.) 
 
The Court declined to hear the argument that s. 19(1)(g) [now s.34(1)(e)] violates 
s. 15 of the Charter.

A35(1)(a), (b) and (c) 
Jurisprudence 
Adam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1997), 137 F.T.R. 68 (Fed. 
T.D.) 
 
The Federal Court held in the case of Adam (F.C.T.D., IMM-3380-96, August 29, 
1997; upheld on appeal by F.C.A., A-19-98, January 11, 2001) that there is no 
rebuttable presumption for those who held one of the government positions listed [in 
the Regulations], meaning that if a person is found to have occupied the position 
mentioned, that fact in itself will result in inadmissibility even if there is nothing to 
show that the person actually exercised influence on the regime in question. 
 
In matters where ministerial discretion may be exercised, reasons may be required 
where the decision on its face seems perverse. 
Esse v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (January 16, 1998), Doc. 
IMM-4523-96 (Fed. T.D.) 
 
The purpose of A35(1)(b) is to ensure that Canada does not become a haven for 
persons who have engaged in terrorism, systematic or gross human rights 
violations, war crimes or crimes against humanity. 
 
Persons holding specific positions within a government are deemed to be senior 
members of or senior officials in the service of a government for that purpose. To 
obtain a Minister’s acceptance, one would have to demonstrate that, 
notwithstanding their position, there was no complicity in the objectionable acts of 
that government. 
Hussein v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1997), 41 Imm. L.R. (2d) 
42 (Can. Imm. & Ref. Bd. (App.Div.)) 
Rudolph v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1992), 73 C.C.C. (3d) 
442, 91 D.L.R. (4th) 686 (Fed. C.A.) 
 
Double criminality—paragraph 19(1)(j) of the Immigration Act, 1976, in conjunction 
with subsection 7(3.6) of the Criminal Code, mandates the notional transfer to 
Canadian soil of the actus reus only and not of the entire surrounding 
circumstances so as to permit a plea of obedience to de facto foreign state 
authority. The fact that the German government ordered or condoned the 
applicant’s conduct during WWII is no defence to a charge of doing the same thing 
in Canada. 
A36(1)(a), (b) and (c) 
Jurisprudence 
Barnett v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1996), 33 Imm. L.R. (2d) 1, 
109 F.T.R. 154 (Fed. T.D.) 
 
Where another country, whose legal system is based on similar foundation and 
values as our own, has enacted legislation which reflects goals and objectives 
analogous to those encompassed within our own system, then that law should be 
accorded respect and recognized for purposes of Canadian immigration law. 
 
The question is not whether Canada has identical legislation in place but whether 
the underlying rationale of the foreign legislation is consistent with some 
fundamental principle of justice esteemed within our society.

 
A foreign pardon granted under a legal system that reflects goals and objectives 
analogous to those encompassed within our own should be followed for the 
purpose of Canadian immigration law. 
Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Fenner (December 11, 1981), 
Doc. V81-6126 (Imm. App. Bd.) 
 
A foreign legal procedure that is not equivalent to an absolute or conditional 
discharge will not be treated as such in Canada. The conviction remains for the 
purpose of A36(1). 
Dayan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1987), 78 N.R. 134 (Fed. 
C.A.) 
 
Test for equivalency. 
 
Reliance on the concept of offences as malum in se to prove equivalency with the 
provisions of the Canadian Criminal Code is a device that should be resorted to 
only when, for a very good reason, proof of foreign law has been difficult to make, 
and then only when the foreign law is that of a non-common law country. 
Halm v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1995), 27 C.R.R. (2d) 23, 
91 F.T.R. 106 
 
Equivalency is not met in the case where the Canadian statute is struck down for 
unconstitutionality. 
 
Equivalency is not required to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. All that is 
required is that the adjudicator determine that the applicant is a person with respect 
to whom there are “reasonable grounds to believe” that they have been convicted 
outside of Canada of an equivalent offence. 
Hill v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1987), 1 Imm. L.R. (2d) 1, 73 
N.R. 315 (Fed. C.A.) 
 
Onus lies on [hearings officers] to present evidence of foreign law and necessary 
definitions. 
Kiani v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1995), 96 F.T.R. 241, 31 
Imm. L.R. (2d) 269 
 
Foreign police reports, oral admissions, and other circumstantial evidence may be 
enough to prove that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant was 
convicted of a serious offence abroad. 
Lavi v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (April 24, 1985), Doc. T-83-
9929 (Imm. App. Bd.) 
 
Although the Minister establishes equivalency with a section of the Criminal Code, 
the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) is not restricted to the provisions 
selected, but is able to explore various other provisions of Canadian law. 
Legault v. Canada (Secretary of State) (1997), 42 Imm. L.R. (2d) 192, 133 F.T.R. 320 
(note), 219 N.R. 376 (Fed. C.A.); leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1998), 227 N.R. 
(note) (S.C.C.) 
 
“Reasonable grounds” are enough to show that the applicant falls within A36(1)(b) 
and (c). In this case, a warrant and indictment were sufficient. 
Lei v. Canada (Solicitor General) (1994), 74 F.T.R. 67 
 
If the Canadian statute is narrower than the foreign equivalent, the adjudicator must 
be presented with additional evidence surrounding the circumstances to establish

that the person would have been convicted if the same offence were committed in 
Canada. 
Leung v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (May 3, 2000), Doc. A-283-
98 (Fed. C.A.) 
 
It is not incumbent on the visa officer to question the reasonableness of the 
Minister’s decision. 
Lui v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1997), 39 Imm. L.R. (2d) 60, 
134 F.T.R. 308 (Fed. T.D.) 
 
The following test must be used when determining equivalency (for convictions or 
pardons) between Canadian and foreign law: 
 the laws and legal system of the foreign jurisdiction must be similar to those of 
Canada; 
 the foreign law in question must be similar in (a) aim or purpose; (b) content; 
and (c) effect, but not necessarily identical to the Canadian law. 
Masasi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1997), 40 Imm. L.R. (2d) 
133, 138 F.T.R. 121 (Fed. T.D.) 
 
When establishing equivalency between foreign and Canadian offences, it is 
necessary to establish the essential elements of the offences AND to actually 
examine them in order to determine whether they were equivalent or not. 
Mohammad v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1989), 2 F.C. 363, 
55 D.L.R. (4th) 321, 21 F.T.R. 240 (note) (Fed. C.A.) 
 
It is not a precondition that the Minister shall have considered the question of 
rehabilitation. The fact that a person described in A36 does not possess proof of 
satisfaction of the Minister is sufficient evidence for inadmissibility. 
 
The immigration officer is not required to give the person concerned an opportunity 
to answer allegations contained in that report. 
 
There are no problems of institutional independence because the adjudication 
division and the [hearings] officers are separate divisions that do not provide or take 
advice to/from the other. 
R. v. Wardley (1978), 43 C.C.C. (2d) 345 (Ont. C.A.) 
 
If the person is charged with an indictable offence and pleads guilty to an included 
offence, then the plea constitutes a plea of guilty to the indictable offence and the 
maximum sentence for the conviction of the indictable offence governs with respect 
to penalty. 
Robertson v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1979] 1 F.C. 197, 43 
C.C.C. (2d) 354, 91 D.L.R. (3d) 93 (Fed. C.A.) 
 
The person can be deported under A36 only if the maximum punishment is 10 
years’ imprisonment at the date of the deportation order. If it was 10 years (or more) 
but has since been reduced, then the person cannot be deported under A36. 
Saini v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000), 184 D.L.R. (4th) 568 
(Fed. T.D.) 
 
An officer cannot ignore a valid pardon given in another country with a similar 
justice system.

 
Lack of a certificate of the applicant’s conviction leaves something to be desired in 
the particularity of the evidence, however, it will not automatically result in the 
applicant’s entry into Canada. 
Smith v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1998), 44 Imm. L.R. (2d) 
154, [1998] 3 F.C. 144, 152 F.T.R. 242 (Fed. T.D.) 
 
A valid deportation or exclusion order may not be enforced after a record 
suspension has been granted for the offence in question: the conviction has been 
revoked under the Criminal Records Act or there has been a final determination of 
an acquittal. 
Steward v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1988), 84 N.R. 236 
(Fed. C.A.). 
 
Equivalency can be determined in three ways: 
 by comparison of the precise wording in each statute both through documents 
and, if available, through the evidence of an expert or experts in the foreign law 
with a view to determining the essential ingredients of the respective offences; 
 by examining the evidence adduced before the adjudicator, both oral and 
documentary, to ascertain whether or not that evidence was sufficient to 
establish that the essential ingredients of the offence in Canada had been 
proven in the foreign proceedings, whether precisely described in the initiating 
documents or in the statutory provisions in the same words or not; or 
 by a combination of the two. 
Taei v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1993), 19 Imm. L.R. (2d) 187, 
64 F.T.R. 311 (Fed. T.D.) 
 
A Convention refugee that is later accused of committing an act described in A36(1) 
may not be granted permanent resident status until the criminal charges are 
disposed of. 
Taubler v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) [1981] 1 F.C. 620 (Fed. 
C.A.) 
 
In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it was presumed that the equivalent 
foreign law involved the element of mens rea and that a conviction indicates that a 
finding of guilty intent was made. 
Tei v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1998), 48 Imm. L.R. (2d) 120, 
161 F.T.R. 51 (Fed. T.D.) 
 
An applicant who falls under A36(1) and is denied entry into Canada may challenge 
the Minister’s decision not to grant rehabilitation but they may not challenge the 
officer’s decision.

Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Nemsila (1996), 35 Imm. L.R. (2d) 
56, [1997] 1 F.C. 260, 118 F.T.R. 310 (Fed. T.D.), affirmed (1997), 38 Imm. L.R. (2d) 
242, 3 Admin. L.R. (3d) 83, 214 N.R. 383 (Fed. C.A.) 
 
Due to the fact that the applicant’s entry into Canada was based upon deception 
and misrepresentation, they were not lawfully admitted to Canada and therefore 
could not have gained “landing” within the meaning of the Act. Due to the fact the 
respondent was never landed, he was held to never have acquired Canadian 
domicile. 
Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) v. Gudino (1981), [1982] 2 F.C. 40, 
124 D.L.R. (3d) 748, 38 N.R. 361 (Fed. C.A.) 
 
An applicant who obtains a visa under material circumstances that change (e.g., 
loss of employer as sponsor) must report the change in circumstances to an 
Immigration officer.

 
A visa is no more than a stamp on a piece of paper issued outside Canada which 
may give the holder a colour of right to come into Canada, but no more. Immigration 
status is acquired at the port-of-entry. A change in marital status (from single to 
married) is a material fact that must be disclosed. 
Coombs v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1982] 1 F.C. 113 (Fed. 
C.A.) 
 
The question “Are you a resident of Canada?” does not necessarily mean 
“permanent resident”. 
D’Souza v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1983] 1 F.C. 343 (Fed. 
C.A.) 
 
An applicant need not be aware of a misrepresentation made on his behalf by 
another in order to qualify under A40. 
Devrim v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (April 24, 1979), Doc. 78-
6192 (Imm. App. Bd.) 
 
A40(1)(a) imposes an obligation of absolute liability and thus the defence of due 
diligence is not available. 
Jaber v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1999), 3 Imm. L.R. (3d) 30, 
[2000] 1 F.C. 603, 250 N.R. 235, 180 D.L.R. (4th) 683 (Fed. C.A.) 
 
A person who obtains permanent residency via misrepresentation may appeal to 
the Appeal Division of the IRB according to A63. 
Khamsei v. Canada (Minister of Manpower & Immigration), [1981] 1 F.C. 222 (Fed. 
C.A.) 
 
Whether a misrepresentation was of a material fact is a question of fact. There does 
not need to be direct evidence that a visa would not have been granted had there 
been no misrepresentation. 
 
An adjudicator will decide whether failure to disclose results in misrepresentation. 
Medel v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 10 Imm. L.R. (2d) 274, 
[1990] 2 F.C. 345, 113 N.R. 1 (Fed. C.A.) 
 
The applicant must subjectively know that they are withholding information. 
Mohammed v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1997] 3 F.C. 299, 130 
F.T.R. 294 (Fed. T.D.) 
 
The Court rejected the argument that in order for there to be “misrepresentation” 
there must be an act of concealment. One can misrepresent as easily and 
effectively by silence as one can by actively stating a lie. 
 
The Court rejected the argument that a misrepresentation must be knowingly or 
willfully made. 
Moore v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (December 6, 1978), Doc. 
78-3016 (Imm. App. Bd.) 
 
The Board held that mens rea is not an element of A27(2)(g), at least insofar as the 
disclosure of the existence of dependants is concerned.

(3d) 492 (Fed. C.A.)

against the wife of the applicant because she was not herself the subject of an A44 
report.
