      "text": "ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) \n6 \n2025-02-20 \n1 What this chapter is about  \nThis chapter provides guidance to Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and Immigration, \nRefugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) officials performing the function of the Minister’s \nDelegate (MD) and exercising their authority to review reports prepared under A44(1) of the \nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).  \n2 Program objectives  \nThe objectives of Canadian immigration legislation with regard to the inadmissibility provisions \nare: \n \nto protect the health and safety of Canadians and to maintain the security of \nCanadian society; \n \nto promote international justice and security by fostering respect for human rights \nand denying access to Canadian territory to persons, including refugee claimants, \nwho are criminals or security risks. \n3 The Act and Regulations  \nUnder A44(1), an officer may prepare and transmit a report if that officer is of the opinion that a \npermanent resident or foreign national in Canada is inadmissible. Under A44(2), all A44(1) \nreports must be referred to the MD to determine the accuracy and validity of the report and to \ndecide whether to:   \n \nissue a removal order, where the MD has jurisdiction to do so; or  \n \nrefer the matter to the Immigration Division (ID) of the Immigration and Refugee Board \n(IRB) for an admissibility hearing. \nThe IRPA provides authority both to members of the ID and to the MD to issue removal orders, \ndepending on the type of allegation contained in the A44(1) report, and pursuant to the authority \nprescribed in the IRPA and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) . \nIn order to streamline the enforcement process in cases involving straightforward allegations, \nand to maintain the principle that the MD may make determinations in cases where there is little \nneed to weigh evidence, the scheme of the Act and Regulations empowers the MD to issue \nremoval orders under the circumstances prescribed in R228. Generally speaking, the more \ndiscretion and analysis required in assessing the allegation, the more likely the jurisdiction rests \nwith a member of the ID.   \nIt is important to note that where the MD is authorized to make removal orders under R228, this \nauthority applies at both ports of entry and at inland offices.  \nThe following table includes some of the most relevant provisions that may apply during the \nA44(2) process. Some of the authorities listed below pertain specifically to CBSA Border \nServices Officers (BSOs) at the port of entry or IRCC officers assessing applications; others are \nmore relevant to CBSA Inland Enforcement Officers (IOEs). \n \n \n \n"

This is referred to as the designation of authority. In addition, A6(2) authorizes \nthat anything that may be done by the Minister under the Act may be done by a person that the \nMinister authorizes in writing. This is referred to as delegation of authority.   \n \nEach Minister who has responsibilities under the IRPA has written an instrument of delegation \nand designation that is periodically updated. The Delegation of Authority and Designations of \nOfficers (D & D) instruments stipulate who has the authority to perform specific immigration-\nrelated functions. CBSA and IRCC personnel are designated by position to perform all \ndelegated or designated authorities, including those associated with A44(1)/A44(2) functions.  It \nis to be noted that the IRPA D & D instruments have a hierarchical link which means only the \nlowest level of authority is included in the D & D instruments as every position above this one \n(with a direct hierarchical link) has the same authority to perform specific immigration-related \nfunctions. \n \nCBSA and IRCC officials acting in the capacity of the MD in A44(2) proceedings should always \nreview both the CBSA and the IRCC D & D instruments as they have authorities delegated and \ndesignated under both instruments, which can be found on the IL 3-  Designation of Officers and \nDelegation of Authority.  \n \nThe authority to review A44(1) reports has been delegated to certain CBSA and IRCC officials. \nIt is important to note that while IRCC officers have been delegated the authority to review \nreports for most inadmissibility sections, A44(1) reports for inadmissibility under A34 (security \ngrounds), A35 (grounds of violating human or international rights), A35.1 (sanctions) and A37 \n(grounds of organized criminality) may only be prepared and reviewed by CBSA.  \n \nAll reports written by CBSA or IRCC officers will be reviewed by the MD who has been \ndelegated the authority under the D & D instruments. If the MD is of the opinion that the report is \nwell-founded, the MD will make the appropriate decision based on the evidence and determine \nwhether to:  \n \n \nissue a removal order, if the allegation is within the MD’s authority pursuant to R228; or  \n \nrefer the report to the ID pursuant to the R229. \nFor additional information, see Appendix A — ‘Table: Immigration and Refugee Protection Act \n(IRPA) Inadmissible Classes’  \n \nNote:  Policy requires that even where officers and officials acting in the capacity of the \nMinister’s Delegate (including chiefs and directors) have the delegated authority under \nthe D & D instruments, they should not perform Minister's Delegate functions and \nreviews until they have successfully completed the necessary training to perform the \nA44(2) function.

In general terms, this means the MD must: \n \nAllow the person concerned the opportunity to know the case to be met and present \nall relevant facts of the case; \n \nInform the person concerned about the purpose and possible outcomes of the MD \nproceedings; \n \nProvide the person concerned with a reasonable opportunity to respond; \n \nAllow the person to respond to facts or new information that will be considered by the \ndecision-maker; \n \nFully and fairly consider the evidence; \n \nRender decisions that are impartial and free from bias; \n \nProvide the notice of decision and reasons for the decision to the person concerned; \n \nInform the person concerned of a right to counsel if an A44(2) MD proceeding is \ncaused where the person is detained and the Minister has the authority to issue a \nremoval order;  \n \nEnsure that an interpreter is provided where necessary  \nIt is important to differentiate those cases where the MD may issue a removal order and those \ncases where the jurisdiction to issue a removal order lies with the ID, as different procedural \nrequirements and considerations will apply in order to ensure that procedural fairness and \nnatural justice are met.  \nThe content of procedural fairness will also depend on the status of the person concerned and \nadditional considerations will apply for permanent residents and protected persons.  \nFor additional information, see ENF 5 Writing 44(1) reports:  section 6.1,  ‘Procedural fairness’; \nsection 8, ‘Considerations before reviewing an A44(1) report- Scope of officer discretion’;  \nsection 9.2, ‘Special considerations for protected persons’; section 10, ‘A44(1) reports \nconcerning permanent residents of Canada’. \nIn reaching a decision, the MD must take into account representations made by persons or by \ntheir counsel, and make particular note of the nature and content of these representations. All \ndecisions of the MD are subject to judicial review, with leave, by the Federal Court of Canada. \nCertain decisions that the MD makes may be subject to appeal before the Immigration Appeal \nDivision (IAD), where a statutory right of appeal exists under the IRPA. \nIndividuals subject to A44 proceedings have the right to know the case against them, which \ngenerally includes understanding what information the MD would rely on in making a decision. \nEach case, however, must turn on its facts and the level of disclosure required at the A44 stage \nmay vary depending on the circumstances of the case.  \nIf an MD relies on new information [i.e., information that was not already provided at the A44(1) \nstage] that is material and that the person concerned would not otherwise be aware of or have \n"

Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 174]. This is \nparticularly important where the MD has jurisdiction to issue the removal order, as a higher level \nof procedural fairness will apply. Conversely, in cases where the ID has the jurisdiction to issue \nthe removal order, there is no duty to disclose other than information which is “material and \notherwise unknown or unavailable” at A44(1) or A44(2) since the person will be entitled to \nreceive disclosure in the context of an admissibility hearing [Jeffrey v. Canada (Public Safety \nand Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 1180]. With respect to all requests for disclosure, MDs \nshould always be cognizant of the legal rules and restrictions on the general disclosure of \ndocuments (e.g., Privacy Act, information sharing agreements, etc.). For further details, MDs \nshould refer to ENF 5 Writing 44(1) reports, section 12.5, ‘Disclosure of documents’. \n6.2 Procedures for persons less than 18 years old or persons unable to \nappreciate the nature of the proceedings \nR228(4) provides for specific safeguards for certain vulnerable persons by requiring that where \nthe person: \n \nis under 18 years of age and not accompanied by a parent or an adult legally \nresponsible for them;  or  \n \nis unable, in the opinion of the Minister, to appreciate the nature of the proceedings and \nis not accompanied by a parent or an adult legally responsible for them; \nthe matter must be referred to the ID for an admissibility hearing. In these cases, the MD does \nnot have jurisdiction to issue a removal order.   \nSuch cases will call for a higher degree of procedural fairness at the A44 stage and officers and \nMDs must take extra care to ensure that the person’s interests are represented and that the \nevidence has been fully and fairly considered. \nDuring the ID proceedings, a designated representative will be appointed pursuant to A167(2) to \nrepresent the person’s interests and ensure that procedural fairness requirements are met with \nrespect to presenting evidence relevant to the case and providing a response to facts or new \ninformation that will be considered by the decision-maker. In these hearings, parties will also be \ngoverned by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Chairperson Guideline 8: \n‘Procedures With Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB’ \nWhere a person appears to be unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings, it is \nimportant for the MD to identify this as soon as possible during the A44(2) proceedings. Where \nthe MD, in the course of their interactions with a person, has identified that a person has a \nsuspected or known mental illness and does not appreciate the nature of the proceedings, this \nshould be clearly documented in the MD’s decision so that in cases where the case is being \nreferred for an admissibility hearing, the need for a designated representative is flagged for the \nID. \nIn such cases, the MD should also ensure that other departmental and agency guidelines with \nrespect to dealing with vulnerable persons are followed. See section 6.6, ‘Dealing with \nvulnerable persons’; ENF 20 Detention; and ENF 34 Alternatives to Detention. \nFor additional guidance on how to identify a vulnerable person, see IRCC Program delivery \ninstructions on Processing in-Canada claims for refugee protection of minors and vulnerable \npersons. \n"

Officials carrying out the administration of the IRPA must respect the right of the \nindividual to proceed in French or English. In order to ensure that procedural fairness is \nmaintained, MDs should ensure that all the Minister’s documents are provided in the language \nof the proceedings and, where necessary, obtain translations (e.g., a certificate of conviction \nfrom another country that is not in French or English that the Minister is relying on as evidence). \n6.4 Interpreters \nThe MD must be satisfied that the person concerned is able to understand and communicate in \neither of the official languages in which the proceeding is being held. If necessary, an interpreter \nis to be provided to enable the persons to understand and communicate fully.  \nNote:  Travellers arriving at a port of entry into Canada do not have an automatic right to an \ninterpreter upon request during routine port of entry examinations, however there are situations \nwhere officers at the port of entry are required to suspend the proceedings until a qualified \ninterpreter is available. This may include circumstances where the officer is considering denying \nentry to the traveller. For further information, see Nere v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), \n2018 FC 672. \nCBSA officers should consult guidelines on the use of interpreters contained in ENF 4 Port of \nentry examinations (section 8.5 ‘Use of interpreters’).  \nFor further information see IRCC Program delivery instructions (PDI) on interpreters. \n6.5 Counsel  \nPersons do not have a right to counsel at MD review proceedings, unless they are detained. In \nall detained cases, persons must be given the opportunity to obtain and instruct counsel at their \nown expense. Counsel includes a barrister, solicitor, family member, consultant or friend. \nIn detained cases: The MD must inform persons of their right to counsel prior to commencing \nthe MD review. This right applies in all cases (port of entry and inland) where a person is \ndetained under an Act of Parliament and includes situations where the person is detained by the \ncriminal courts while facing charges or serving a sentence and subject to IRPA proceedings. \nPort of entry:  Generally, CBSA’s policy is not to permit counsel at MD review proceedings \nunless arrest/detention has occurred. However if the MD is dealing with an individual who does \nhave counsel present, the officer should allow the counsel to remain present as long as counsel \ndoes not interfere with the examination process. \nNote:  In Dehghani v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] 1 S.C.R. \n1053], the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) determined that the principles of fundamental \njustice do not include the right to counsel for routine information-gathering, such as that \ngathered at port of entry examination interviews. The SCC further held that an Immigration \nSecondary examination at a port of entry does not constitute a detention within the meaning of \nparagraph 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.1  \n                                                          \n1 Although the SCC held that secondary examination does not constitute detention, this decision also \nhighlighted that detention within the meaning of section 10(b) of the Charter would result where restraints \non the person’s liberty by state authorities have gone beyond those required for the routine processing or \n"

Call-in notices for MD reviews should advise the person that they \nmay have counsel present for the MD review. MDs are not obligated to postpone MD review \nproceedings in non-detained cases due to counsel unavailability, however, may consider such \nrequests on case-by-case basis. \nWhere counsel is representing the person concerned at the proceeding, the MD should ensure \nthat counsel’s identity, the fact of counsel’s presence at the proceeding and statements made \nby counsel on behalf of the person concerned are documented in the their notes, and that \ncounsel’s representations have been considered in their decision. The MD may also need the \nperson’s representative to complete a Use of a Representative form (IMM 5476). For further \ninformation, see IRCC Program delivery instructions on Use of Representatives. \nParticipation by counsel involves speaking on the client's behalf, presenting evidence and \nmaking submissions on the issues. Allowing counsel to participate does not mean that the MD is \nrequired to tolerate disruptive or discourteous behaviour by counsel. Where such conduct is \nencountered, the MD may require counsel to leave and/or the proceeding may be adjourned to \nanother time. In such cases, the MD should ensure to document their reasons for taking such \naction. \n6.6 Dealing with vulnerable persons in the context of A44 \n6.6.1 Considerations for vulnerable persons in the context of A44 \n \nIt is an overall goal of Canada’s immigration program to treat all persons with dignity and \nrespect. In exercising their IRPA authorities, officials must approach all cases in a \nnonjudgmental manner, remain sensitive to the potential needs and limitations of vulnerable \npersons, and recognize that a person they are dealing with may have experienced some form of \nviolence, abuse or trauma. \n \nIn the context of A44, vulnerable persons may face particular challenges, including an impaired \nability to answer questions/provide information to officials respecting a potential IRPA \ninadmissibility, due to a physical or psychological frailty or for other reasons. Such persons may \ninclude, but would not be limited to: \n \n \nminors (under 18 years of age), including unaccompanied minors; \n \nelderly persons; \n \nindividuals with severe medical conditions or physical disabilities;  \n \npersons with a suspected or known mental illness; \n \npersons who have suffered traumatic experiences that resulted in some degree of \nvulnerability, including: \n                                                          \nscreening of their application to enter Canada. Further, while the SCC’s decision affirmed that delays in \nroutine examinations due to operational necessity do not mean the person is “detained”, officers should \nbe cognizant that unreasonably lengthy delays in the examination could lead to the conclusion that the \nperson is detained within the meaning of section 10(b) of the Charter.  \n \n"

In some instances, officers/MDs will need to use their observational \nskills, discretion and sound judgement in identifying a person as vulnerable.   \n \n \nRecognize that a vulnerable individual’s ability to respond to questions or provide \ninformation may be severely impaired, and remain sensitive to the impact of a perceived \nvulnerability during the A44 process, including during interviews. \n \n \nTo the extent possible, prevent vulnerable persons from becoming traumatized or re-\ntraumatized during the A44 process. \n \nWhere an individual who is subject to IRPA enforcement action is identified as a victim of \nviolence, trauma or abuse, including victims of GBV, family violence or trafficking in persons, or \nother forms of abuse such as sexual abuse or labour abuse, officers/MDs must take a victim-\ncentered and trauma-informed approach in order to avoid re-victimizing people who report \nviolence or abuse.  \n \nA victim-centred approach focuses on the needs and concerns of victims to ensure a \ncompassionate and sensitive delivery of services in a nonjudgmental manner.  \n \nA trauma-informed approach is one that avoids triggering trauma that may have placed the \nindividual in their current situation. \n \nThe guidelines in sections 6.6.2 to 6.6.5 are aimed at assisting MDs in identifying vulnerable \npersons and applying a victim-centred and trauma-informed approach when dealing with \nvulnerable persons at A44. \n \nIn addition to the guidelines set out in this manual chapter, MDs should always ensure that other \nDepartmental and Agency guidelines with respect to dealing with vulnerable persons and \nminors are followed, including IRCC’s Program delivery instructions on Identifying sensitive \ncases and on Processing in-Canada claims for refugee protection of minors and vulnerable \npersons, where applicable. \n6.6.2 Sexual orientation and gender identity and expression and sex characteristics3 \n \nSome IRPA enforcement cases may involve individuals with, or who are perceived to have, \n                                                          \n2 It is important to recognize wherever the term “victim” is used, that some persons who have experienced \nviolence, trauma or abuse may prefer to be referred to as “survivors” rather than “victims”. \n \n3 Please note that terminology in this section may have further evolved following the publication date of \nthis manual.

IPV can occur in many types of relationships, including \nbetween married or common-law spouses as well as within dating relationships, regardless of \ngender and sexual orientation and whether or not the partners co-habit. \n \nFor further information respecting IPV, see the Government of Canada’s Fact sheet on Intimate \npartner violence. \n \nDepending on their cultural background, victims of GBV may be reluctant to disclose their \nexperiences in order to not “shame” their families or communities. Similarly, women who have \nbeen subjected to IPV/domestic violence or abuse may also be reluctant to provide information, \nespecially against the alleged perpetrator. MDs should be alert to such cases and will ensure to \nthe extent possible that specific accommodations are made during interviews as set out  (e.g., \nhave a female officer either conduct or be present during an interview, and arrange, if possible, \nfor a female interpreter).

At the port of entry, this may include allowing the \nperson to withdraw their application to enter Canada (i.e. Allowed to leave) or issuing a \nTemporary resident permit (TRP) to overcome an inadmissibility that may have resulted \nfrom GBV.

While \nonly IRCC officials may issue TRPs to VTIPs or victims of family violence, CBSA officials should \nfollow the guidelines set out in the IRCC Program delivery instructions for handling these cases. \nFor example, cases in which a foreign national is identified by the CBSA as a VTIP or victim of \nfamily violence should be referred to the responsible IRCC local office on an urgent basis.

Knowledge of what may be required \nto substantiate an allegation of inadmissibility is an important consideration in all cases. \nEach allegation has specific requirements for evidence and officers are to be guided by the \ncontent of ENF 1 Inadmissibility; ENF 2 Evaluating Inadmissibility; and ENF 18 Human or \ninternational rights violations. \nIn order to make a decision on the validity of an A44(1) report, the MD must be satisfied that the \napplicable burden and standard of proof may be met and that sufficient evidence has been or \nmay be gathered to ensure that each element of an inadmissibility allegation may be satisfied. \n7.4 Burden of proof  \nThe burden of proof, in the context of immigration legislation, refers to who is responsible for \nestablishing admissibility under the IRPA. \nUnder A45(d), the burden of establishing admissibility depends on whether or not the person \nhas been authorized to enter Canada.  \nIn cases of foreign nationals who are seeking entry (primarily applicable to port of entry cases) \nor those who entered Canada illegally, the onus is on the individual to establish that they are not \ninadmissible. Where the person has been authorized to enter Canada the burden to establish \ninadmissibility is on the Minister. \nTable 3:  Burden of proof \nPersons authorized/not \nauthorized to enter \nDetails \nBurden of proof \nPermanent residents and \nforeign nationals authorized \nto enter \nA45(d) requires the Immigration Division to \nmake a removal order against a \npermanent resident or a foreign national \nwho has been authorized to enter Canada, \nif it is satisfied that they are inadmissible. \nConsequently, in cases involving persons \nwho were granted entry into Canada, \nincluding permanent residents, the onus \nrests on the Minister to establish that the \nperson is inadmissible. \n \n \nMinister \n"

A21(1) states that a foreign \nnational becomes a permanent resident \nand A22(1) states that a foreign national \nbecomes a temporary resident if an officer \nis satisfied that, inter alia, the foreign \nnational is not inadmissible. \nThis applies to persons seeking entry into \nCanada or those persons who have \nentered illegally.

However A33 provides that, unless \notherwise provided, the standard of proof for allegations listed under sections A34 to A37, is a \nlower standard of proof: reasonable grounds to believe that the facts have occurred, are \noccurring or may occur, applies. \n \n“Balance of Probabilities” is a civil standard of proof used in administrative tribunals. It means \nthat the evidence presented must show that the facts as alleged are more probable than not. \nThe party having the burden of proof must demonstrate that the evidence presented outweighs \nany opposing evidence or arguments. It is a higher standard of proof than “reasonable grounds \nto believe”, but is lower than the criminal standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt” used in \ncriminal proceedings. \n \n“Reasonable grounds to believe” is a bona fide belief in a serious possibility that fact has \nbeen established based on credible evidence. Reasonable grounds to believe is more than \nsuspicion. Some objective basis for the belief has to exist. Put another way, the fact itself need \nnot be proven; it is enough to show reasonable grounds for believing the allegation true. \nInformation used to establish reasonable grounds should be specific, compelling, credible and \nbe received from a reliable source. \n \nThe following table summarizes the standard of proof for sections A34 to A42: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n"

In such cases, the officer \nshould advise the person that while it has been established that they have a right to enter \nCanada, there are reasons to believe that they could become the subject of a report under the \nIRPA which could lead to the issuance of a removal order.

The MD has the discretion to take other action within the exercise of their \ndelegated authority as set out in the IRPA and the IRPR. However, as will be seen in this \nsection, the scope of discretion of the MD is limited. \n \nThe use of the word “may” in the IRPA suggests that Parliament intended to provide the officer \nand the MD with some discretion on decisions made under A44(1) and A44(2). While the body \nof case law respecting this scope of discretion varies, Canadian jurisprudence does affirm that \nan MD’s discretion under A44 is limited. \n \nThe discretion under A44(1) and A44(2) does not mean that officers and MDs can disregard the \nfact that someone is, or may be, inadmissible. The discretion under A44 is meant to give officers \nand MDs some flexibility in managing cases where circumstances warrant that no removal order \nwill be sought and where the objectives of the IRPA may or will be achieved without the need to \nwrite an inadmissibility report under A44(1) or issue a removal order/refer the case to the ID \nunder A44(2).  \n \nThe courts have also found that this scope of discretion varies depending on the inadmissibility \ngrounds alleged, whether the person concerned is a permanent resident or a foreign national, \nand whether the MD or the ID has the authority to issue a removal order. In other words, the \nscope of discretion has been viewed as “variable and flexible”.7 \n \nFor example, in the case of Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. \nCha, 2006 FCA 126, a case involving a foreign national inadmissible under paragraph 36(2)(a) \n                                                          \n7 Sharma v.

The FCA held that with \nrespect to foreign nationals inadmissible for criminality or serious criminality, officers and MDs \nhave limited discretion under A44(1) and A44(2). The Court further outlined that the particular \ncircumstances of the foreign national, the nature of the offence, the conviction, and the \nsentence are beyond the scope of the discretionary power of the officer when considering \nwhether or not to write an A44(1) report for criminality or serious criminality against a foreign \nnational. The FCA also concluded that permanent residents have more rights and therefore \nbenefit from more discretion by decision-makers than foreign nationals do.   \n \nMore recent jurisprudence8 confirms that officers and MDs making decisions under A44 have \nvery limited discretion on whether to refer a case for an admissibility hearing, particularly in \nmatters concerning serious criminality and organized criminality, and that there is no obligation \nfor officers or MDs to consider factors related to H&C or ‘personal circumstances’. These \ndecisions also confirm that at this the 44 stage, officers and MDs are conducting a fact-finding \nmission into “readily and objectively ascertainable facts” and that this administrative screening \nfunction applies to both foreign nationals and permanent residents. \n \nIn general, discretion under A44 means that officers and MDs have some flexibility in managing \ncases where the person is inadmissible, however the objectives of the IRPA may or will be \nachieved without the need to write a report under A44(1) or, at the MD level, issue a removal \norder or A44(2) referral, for example:  \n \n \nwhere an MD allows a withdrawal of an application to enter Canada (Allowed to Leave) \noption at a port of entry after an A44(1) report has been written; \n \nwhere a person is already subject to an enforceable removal order and the MD \ndetermines that the objectives of the IRPA would not be served by the issuance of an \nadditional removal order and determines that a disposition of “no further action” on the \nA44(2) report would be appropriate; \n \nwhere an MD decides to issue a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) to a foreign national \ntaking into account the relevant assessment risk factors set out in agency and \ndepartmental guidance (e.g., foreign national who is seeking entry to work in Canada \nand who was convicted of a non-violent offence many years ago);  \n \nwhere the MD holds the A44(2) review in abeyance pending the decision on an \napplication to IRCC for restoration of status by a foreign national who has remained in \nCanada beyond the period authorized; or \n \nwhere the MD decides that the issuance of a warning letter for a permanent resident or \nprotected person reported under A36(1) is warranted, in consideration of all of the \ncircumstances of the case, including the objectives under paragraphs A3(1)(h) and (i) of \nthe IRPA.  \n                                                          \n8 Obazughanmwen v.

Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), \n2016 FCA 319, that within the context of A44, officers and the MD must always be mindful of \nParliament’s intention in drafting the IRPA to make security of Canadians a top priority. \nIn Sharma, the FCA also concluded that the FCA’s rationale in Cha in support of a limited \ndiscretion under A44 would appear to apply equally to both foreign nationals and permanent \nresidents. \n \nAlthough the factors contained in these guidelines may be considered at the A44(2) stage, \nofficers and MDs must always be mindful of the various objectives of the IRPA, in particular \nA3(1)(h) and (i). As suggested by Federal Court jurisprudence, in cases of inadmissibility under \nA34 to A37, the scope of discretion enjoyed by officers and MDs making a decision under A44 \nwill be very narrow and generally it is reasonably open to officers and MDs to prioritize public \nsafety and security.  \n8.3 Special considerations for protected persons \n \nUnder the IRPA, protected persons are provided with certain protections, including the right of \nnon-refoulement under A115(1) and, subject to A64, the right under A63(3) to appeal to the IAD \nagainst a decision to make a removal order against them. This was recognized by Justice \nDécary in Cha, who noted that the Act and the Regulations treat permanent residents differently \nthan Convention Refugees who are, in turn, treated differently than other foreign nationals.      \n \nIt should be noted that the Federal Court jurisprudence would support that protected persons \nare not entitled to a higher degree of procedural fairness or participatory rights with respect to \nthe operation of A44 than other foreign nationals or permanent residents [see Awed v. Canada \n(Citizenship and Immigration) 2006 FC 469].  Officers and MDs should also keep in mind that \nthe Federal Court has made findings to support the principle that officials carrying out A44(1) \nand (2) assessments are not obliged to speculate about how and when future deportation might \ntake place [Faci v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2011 FC 693]. \n \nIn cases of protected persons, the MD may also consider as an additional factor in their \nassessment, whether the facts of the case would support a referral for a Ministerial opinion \n(‘Danger Opinion’) under A115(2). For further information, see ENF 5, section 14.5, ‘Overview:  \nMinister's opinions/interventions’. \n \n \n9 Charter considerations \n \nThe purpose of this section is to provide guidance to officials performing MD functions under \nA44(2) in handling Charter and/or constitutional arguments made in the course of A44(2) \nproceedings.  \n \nThe jurisprudence respecting the application of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 9 \n(Charter) at the A44(2) stage is in a state of flux.10 Therefore, current guidance to MDs is \nconstrained by the evolving state of the law in this area. \n                                                          \n9 Constitution Act, 1982, Part I Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms \n \n10 For example, see Revell v.

For example, in Brar v. Canada, 2016 FC \n1214, the Federal Court expressed doubts that section 7 rights could be engaged by the A44(2) \nreferral decision, and, in a related case, reiterated that section 7 rights are not engaged at the \nreferral stage (Brar v.

If an officer has concerns/doubts \nabout the foreign national’s bona fides, the foreign national must be made aware of these \nconcerns and given an opportunity to respond to them.  \n \nSome examples of dual intent could include: \n \n \na foreign national frequently visiting a Canadian spouse who has complied with previous \nconditions of entry and is otherwise not inadmissible, even if an application for \npermanent residence has not yet been submitted; \n \na foreign national who has applied or intends to apply for permanent residence, but is \nvisiting Canada to assess employment opportunities, setting up household, etc. \nThe Federal Court in Rebmann v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2005 FC 301 held that an officer \nis required to take into account the foreign national's dual intent in entering/remaining in Canada \nas a temporary resident and provide analysis of the relevant evidence with regards to the \nforeign national’s intention to establish permanent residence in Canada to show that the foreign \nnational will not leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay as a temporary \nresident. \n \nOfficers and MDs should distinguish between a foreign national whose intentions are bona fide \nand a foreign national who has no intention of leaving Canada at the end of their authorized stay \nif the application for permanent residence is refused.  \n \nThe possibility that a foreign national may, at some point in the future, be approved for \npermanent residence does not absolve the individual from meeting the requirements of a \ntemporary resident, specifically, to leave Canada at the end of the period authorized for their \nstay, in accordance with section R179. \n \n"

These factors should \nbe considered before proceeding with administrative enforcement action under A44(1) or \nA44(2).   \n \nOfficers are reminded to use their own judgment and the flexibility afforded to them by \nsubsection A22(2) when making decisions on cases where the foreign national also has the \nintention to become a permanent resident. \n \nFor further guidance on assessing dual intent considerations, see IRCC Program delivery \ninstructions on Dual intent.  See also:  ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. \n10.6 Restoration of status \n \nR182 describes a mechanism by which a visitor, worker or student who has lost temporary \nresident status for having failed to comply with any of the conditions imposed under R185(a), \nR185(b)(i) to (iii) or R185(c), may nevertheless submit an application within the 90-day period of \nthe loss of their status, and if eligible have that status restored.  \n \nIt is important to note that under the D & D instruments, only IRCC officials have the authority to \nconsider an application for restoration of status. \n \nThe application submitted to IRCC shall be approved if the processing officer is satisfied that the \nforeign national continues to meet the initial requirements of their stay, and has not failed to \ncomply with any other conditions imposed and is not the subject of a declaration made under \nA22.1. It is to be noted that an officer shall not restore the status of a student if the student is not \nin compliance with a condition set out in R220.1(1). \n \nNote:  If a temporary resident has applied for an extension of their authorized status before the \nstatus expires, they are considered to have maintained status (formerly referred to as “implied \nstatus”) until a decision is made on their application. Maintained status works by operation of \nlaw [R183(5)], and the temporary resident cannot be reported for non-compliance until a \ndecision is made on their application for an extension, unless other IRPA inadmissibilities are \npresent. For further details regarding procedures for persons with maintained status, see IRCC \nProgram delivery instructions on Temporary residents: Maintained status during processing \n(previously called implied status). \n \nThe following guidelines must be taken into account by Inland Enforcement Officers and MDs \nprior to taking enforcement action in such cases:  \nScenario 1:  Foreign national is out of status, but has applied for restoration of status \nwithin the 90-day period and is otherwise admissible – decision pending \n \nForeign nationals who have submitted an application to have their status restored within the 90-\nday period, and who are not inadmissible under any other section of the Act or Regulations, \nshould not be subject to an A44(1) report. In such circumstances, officers and MDs must allow \nfor a decision to be rendered by IRCC before taking enforcement action, an approach which is \nconsistent with the Federal Court’s findings in Sui v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and \nEmergency Preparedness), 2006 FC 1314. \n"

After taking appropriate steps to \nensure that a restoration application has not been made, should an officer decide to write an \nA44(1) report and refer it to the MD for review, the officer should articulate their reasoning in \npursuing enforcement action in the decision, if such action is pursued prior to the expiration of \nthe 90-day eligibility period.  \n \nWhere the MD receives an A44(1) report for non-compliance within the 90-day restoration \nperiod where the foreign national has not filed an application but is otherwise admissible, the \nMD must then consider R182 and has the discretion to hold the report in abeyance until the 90-\nday eligibility period has lapsed. If the MD decides to proceed with the A44(2) review, the MD \nshould verify whether a restoration application has been or will be filed, and must consider all \nthe circumstances of the case, including the fact that the foreign national is within the 90-day \nrestoration period.   \n \nThis approach is consistent with the Federal Court’s decision in Ouedraogo v. Canada (Public \nSafety and Emergency Preparedness), 2016 FC 810 where the Court noted that the discretion \nof a MD to issue an exclusion order and the ability of a foreign national to apply for restoration of \nstatus are not mutually exclusive – both can occur at the same time. The Court found that the \nsimple existence of an application for restoration does not in and of itself shield a foreign \nnational against enforcement action. In short, where an application for restoration is made, \nalthough the existence of the application should be taken into consideration by the MD when \nthey are exercising their discretion, there is nothing prohibiting the MD from nonetheless making \nan inadmissibility finding where the foreign national is found to be non-compliant with the \nrequirements set out in R185. \n \nIn order to adhere to the principles of procedural fairness and natural justice, officers and MDs \nmust consider each case on its own merits and may consider the following: \n \n \nDoes the foreign national state that they wish to remain in Canada and for what \npurpose? \n \nHas the foreign national already made arrangements to depart Canada in the immediate \nfuture? \n \nIs the foreign national evasive about their departure plans or the intent to remain in \nCanada? \n \nHas the foreign national otherwise been in compliance with the terms and conditions of \ntheir temporary resident status? \n \nIf the foreign national has not applied for a restoration of status, is the officer/MD \nsatisfied that the foreign national will appear for future immigration interviews and/or \ndepart Canada voluntarily? \n \nIf the officer/MD is satisfied that the foreign national will seek to remedy lapsed status \nwithin the 90-day period, then the officer/MD may wish to allow the 90-day application \nperiod to lapse before reviewing the case again in consideration of enforcement action.  \n"

These cases will \nbe rare, and each will need to be assessed on an individual basis taking into consideration all \nrelevant information before proceeding with an in absentia proceeding.  \n \nThe following scenario illustrates an example of exceptional circumstances where an in absentia \nproceeding may be reasonable. \n \nScenario: \n \nA foreign national entered Canada as a member of a crew and shortly after deserted \ntheir vessel. The crew member did not report to CBSA or IRCC within the specified time \nframes under the Regulations and was reported under A44(1). In an attempt to locate \nthe person in Canada, all investigative leads were exhausted. The A44(2) proceeding \nwas held in absentia and after reviewing all the evidence, the report was determined to \nbe well-founded and the person was issued a removal order and a warrant for removal. \n \nThis approach is consistent with the FCA’s findings in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. \nJayamaha Mudalige Don, 2014 FCA 4. While the FCA concluded that it was open to the MD to \nissue the removal order, the court’s finding that procedural fairness was not breached was \nbased on the specific facts of the case (i.e., immigration officials had NO contact information for \nthe person, more than 72 hours had elapsed from the time when the person deserted his ship \nand subparagraph 228(1)(c)(v) of the Regulations expressly provided for the issuance of a \nremoval order). It is important to note that the FCA placed great weight on the fact that the \nperson concerned had an obligation to report to CBSA or IRCC and failed to do so and the \ncoordinates of the person concerned in that case were NOT known to CBSA/IRCC and \ntherefore the person was incapable of being notified.   \n \nNotification when scheduling A44(2) proceedings \n \nNot all A44(2) proceedings will take place on the same day that the A44(1) report is written, for \nnumber of reasons. In some cases, a person may be reported pursuant to A44(1), and the \nreview of that report by a MD will not take place until a MD is available. In these situations, \nreasonable efforts shall be made to notify the person to appear and provide an opportunity to be \nheard at the A44(2) proceeding. ‘Reasonable efforts' will vary from case to case depending on \n"

The officer will refer the case file to the decision-\nmaker with the designated authority to issue a TRP for a final determination. If the decision is \nmade to issue a TRP, the decision-maker will determine the period of validity of the TRP.  \n \nFor further instructions and procedures for TRPs, officers must refer to the IRCC Program \ndelivery Instructions on Temporary resident permits and ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. \n \nAdditional considerations for TRP issuance: \n \nA person is not eligible for a TRP if less than 12 months have passed since their \nclaim for refugee protection was last rejected [or determined to be withdrawn or \nabandoned as described under subsection A24(4)]. \nException: The one-year ban on accessing a TRP under A24(4) does not bar an \nIRCC officer, on their own initiative, from considering a TRP for a victim of human \ntrafficking. \n"

However, the courts have also affirmed that MDs retain the discretion to \nconsider these circumstances, and if they exercise their discretion to do so, the decision must \nbe reasonable. The discretion is tempered by their limited role at A44.19 The guidance in this \nsection is intended to assist MDs determine when and how to exercise such discretion. \n \nMDs must always keep in mind the principles set out in section 8.2 and 15.1 above when \nrendering decisions under A44, including Parliament’s intention in drafting the IRPA to make \nsecurity of Canadians a top priority.  \n \nIn consideration of the various objectives of the IRPA and the limited discretion at A44 as \nconfirmed by the courts, the CBSA’s policy is that MDs must consider the factors below when \ndeciding whether or not to exercise their limited discretion to consider evidence or submissions \nfiled by the person concerned regarding personal circumstances.  \nGenerally speaking, the following factors would weigh against consideration of personal \ncircumstances by the MD: \n \nthe inadmissibility falls under section A34, A35, A35.1 or A37;   \n \n \nA36(1) serious criminality cases in the following circumstances: \no the permanent resident or protected person was previously issued a \nwarning letter by CBSA or had a previous removal order stayed or \nquashed by the IAD on humanitarian and compassionate grounds; \no the reportable offence:  involved violence that resulted in bodily or \npsychological harm to another person, the use of a firearm or is a sexual \noffence; was committed against a vulnerable person (e.g. minor child or \nintellectually or physically challenged persons, or senior citizen), was a \nracially motivated crime, a crime of gender-based violence, including \ndomestic violence, a hate crime or a crime involving trafficking or \nsmuggling in large quantities of a controlled substance or weapons;  \no the criminal record of the permanent resident or protected person \ndemonstrates a pattern of escalating seriousness \n \nIf the decision is not to consider personal circumstances, the MD should state this in their \nA44(2) decision. For example, the MD may state in their decision: “I am not exercising my \ndiscretion to consider evidence and/or submissions filed on behalf of (name of person \nconcerned) pertaining to their personal circumstances given the seriousness of the reportable \noffence”.  \n \n                                                          \n18 Obazughanmwen v.

Are all extended family \nmembers in Canada?  \n• \nDegree of establishment—Is the permanent resident financially self-supporting? Are they \nemployed? Do they have a marketable trade or skill? Has the permanent resident made \nefforts to establish themselves in Canada through language training or skills upgrading? Is \nthere any evidence of community involvement? Has the permanent resident received social \nassistance (frequency/duration)? \n• \nCriminality—Has the permanent resident been convicted of any prior criminal offence? \nBased on reliable information, is the permanent resident involved in criminal or organized \ncrime activities? What is the nature and frequency of the person’s interactions with the law? \n(for further details please refer to ENF 5 Writing 44(1) reports, section 10.1, ‘A44(1) reports \nfor criminality cases’). \n• \nWhat is the potential for rehabilitation? How much time has passed since the last \nconviction? Has the permanent resident already been released? For how long? Has the \npermanent resident accepted culpability, expressed remorse, enrolled in or completed \neducational, skills upgrading or rehabilitation programs (for example, Alcoholics \nAnonymous, Narconon/narcotics rehabilitation programs, anger management programs, life \nskills)? Are family members willing and able to support/assist?  \n• \nHistory of non-compliance and current attitude—Has the permanent resident been \ncooperative and forthcoming with information?

(see section 20.1 of this chapter, ‘Appeals to the Immigration \nAppeal Division’). \nRegardless of the factors being considered, the MD should be aware that there are limitations to \nthe scope of their assessment. For example, the Federal Court has made findings to support the \nprinciple that officials carrying out A44(1) and (2) assessments are not obliged to speculate \nabout how and when future deportation might take place, nor is the expectation that a person’s \nrehabilitation be analyzed in considerable detail.  \n"

Under A64, a loss of appeal \nrights for serious criminality under A36(1)(a) must be with respect to a crime that was punished \nin Canada by a term of imprisonment of at least six months.  Where it is not clear from the \nevidence whether the sentence meets the six month threshold under A64(2), before making any \nassessment under A44(1), the officer should obtain evidence demonstrating how the judge \ncalculated the total sentence imposed as reflected in the court documents, taking into account \nthe imposition of further credits for time served. Regardless of what assessment is made by the \nreporting officer, and especially in cases where the right of appeal is in doubt, the officer and/or \nthe MD should clearly articulate in the recommendation and/or decision that the determination \nas to whether the person concerned retains a right of appeal ultimately rests with the IAD. \n15.4 Preparation of warning letter \nWhere the MD finds that the A44(1) report is well-founded, but that there are other compelling \nreasons, taking into account the objectives of the IRPA, not to refer the A44(1) report to the ID \nfor an admissibility hearing, the MD may exercise their discretion to issue a warning letter. In \nsuch a case, the decision to issue a warning letter constitutes a disposition of the A44(2) \nproceedings on the existing A44(1) report.   \nBased on the limited scope of discretion of the MD, this option to the MD is intended only to be \navailable in cases of permanent residents and, in some circumstances, protected persons who \nremain foreign nationals. Such discretion should not be exercised lightly by the MD and must \ntake into account all of the circumstances of the case, the limited scope of discretion of the MD, \nthe objectives of the IRPA and Agency priorities regarding inadmissibility under A34, A35, \nA35.1, A36(1) and A37.   \nIn addition to the list of factors provided in section 15.2, in cases involving inadmissibility under \nA36(1), MDs should closely examine the nature of the criminal offence when reviewing the \nA44(1) report before issuing a warning letter. \nWhile balancing IRPA objectives regarding public safety and security, the MD may also \nconsider, in cases where the person is a protected person, whether the severity of the acts \ncommitted is such that the CBSA officer will be seeking a Danger Opinion under A115.    \nThe purpose of a warning letter is twofold: it conveys the decision and it is intended to act as a \ndeterrent. \nA warning letter sometimes has a third critical role: if, at some point in the future, the person \nbecomes reportable again (i.e., new circumstances of inadmissibility arise following the \nissuance of the warning letter), the record of the warning letter will be an important factor to \nconsider in an officer’s determination of whether to write a new A44(1) report and/or in the MD’s \ndecision to issue a removal order or refer the new report to the ID, should the person engage in \nfurther unlawful conduct. Officers also rely on the warning letter to demonstrate to the IAD that \nthe person concerned was duly cautioned as to the negative repercussions if another violation \noccurred.  \nIt should be noted, however, that following the issuance of a warning letter, any new A44(1) \nreport must be based on new facts/circumstances. In other words, a new report for the same \nallegation must not arise solely based on the same facts underlying the allegation of the \nprevious report on which the warning letter was issued and the MD cannot re-open the previous \n"

Under the \nIRPA, decision-makers specified in the relevant legislative authority are required to impose the \nbaseline prescribed conditions in prescribed circumstances: CBSA officers are required in \nA44(4) and A56(3); ID is required in A58(5); Minister is required in A58.1(4) and A77.1(1); \nFederal Court is required in A82(6). \n"

Officers and MDs should be aware that there is a \nspecific policy for refugee claimants at the land port of entry. \n \nA person who has been directed to return to the U.S. pending an admissibility hearing by the ID \nand who seeks to come into Canada for reasons other than to appear at that hearing is \nconsidered to be seeking entry. If such a person remains inadmissible for the same reason(s), \nand if a member of the ID is not reasonably available, the person may be directed again to \nreturn to the U.S. to wait until a member of the ID is available. In these circumstances it is not \nnecessary to write a new A44(1) report. \n \nNote: Generally, persons directed back to the U.S. who choose not to return to Canada will not \nbe subject to enforcement action, as they have no desire to continue with their application to \nenter Canada. Such persons will simply be deemed to have withdrawn their application. Officers \nshould therefore not counsel the person that failure to return in these instances will \nautomatically result in enforcement action while the person is not in Canada. \n \nIn exceptional cases, it may be appropriate to pursue enforcement action for persons seeking \nentry who have failed to comply with R44(3). Officers and MDs should consider all information \nand individual circumstances of each case before they elect to proceed with enforcement action \n"

In all other cases, where no statutory right of appeal exists under the IRPA or \nthose rights have been exhausted, there is a right to seek judicial review at the Federal Court of \nCanada. \n20.1 Appeals to the Immigration Appeal Division  \n \nThe MD will encounter three circumstances in which a person against whom they have made a \nremoval order may have a right of appeal to the IAD. Those circumstances involve a person \nwho is: \n \n \na foreign national who holds a permanent resident visa; \n \na permanent resident (inside or outside Canada); and \n \na protected person. \n \nWhere a person has a right to appeal, removal orders are stayed until the end of the appeal \nperiod expires (30 days) if no appeal is made and until the day of final determination of the \nappeal, if an appeal is made. Pursuant to A50(c), if the IAD grants a stay of removal, the  \nremoval order is stayed under A66(b) and A68 until the stay is no longer in force.  \n  \nTable 6:  Right to Appeal— Removal Order \n \nWho has right to \nappeal \nLegislation \nPeriod in which \nappeal must be \nmade \nWho is excluded \nForeign national \nholding a permanent \nresident visa  \nA63(2)* \n30 days after \nreceiving the \ndecision \n \n \nA64(1), A64)(2) \nPermanent resident \n(in Canada) \nA63(3)* \n30 days after \nreceiving the \ndecision \n \n \nA64(1), A64(2) \nPermanent resident \n(outside Canada) \nA63(4) \n60 days to appeal \n \n \nProtected person \n \nA63(3)* \n30 days after \nreceiving the \ndecision \n \nA64(1) \n"

This is easily accomplished \nby giving them a notification of appeal form and informing them of their right to appeal. \n \nThe MD is also to provide the persons with the address and telephone number of the IAD \nregistry office so that the persons may file a notice of appeal with the Registrar if they so \nchoose. \n \nThe MD should also obtain a written acknowledgement from the persons that they have been \nadvised of their right to appeal to the IAD and place it in the case file. \n \nSee Appendix G:  Sample letter—  IAD Appeal Acknowledgement Letter \n20.2 Right to file an application for leave and judicial review— Where no statutory \nright of appeal exists \n \nWhen an MD makes a removal order against a person who does not have the right to appeal to \nthe IAD, the MD is to advise the person of their right to file an application for leave and judicial \nreview with the Federal Court pursuant to A72(1). \n \nFor example, foreign nationals who are not protected persons or who do not hold a permanent \nresident visa have no statutory right of appeal to the IAD against a removal order issued by the \nMD. However, they may challenge a removal order made by the MD at the Federal Court. \n \nIf a statutory appeal, as may be provided for by the IRPA, has not been resolved, neither the \nMinister nor the person concerned may appeal to the Federal Court.  \n \nThe MD should obtain a written acknowledgment from the persons concerned, stating that they \nhave been advised of their right to file an application for leave and judicial review, and place it in \nthe case file.

This \npractice is generally discouraged, especially where the jurisdiction for each inadmissibility does \nnot lie with the same decision-maker (i.e., MD or ID). It should be noted, however, that where a \nreport contains one or more inadmissibility allegation, and if the MD has jurisdiction for all \ninadmissibility allegations contained within that report, the MD can determine the disposition of \nthat report; conversely, where there are several inadmissibility allegations in a report and the \nMD has jurisdiction for only some of them, the MD is not authorized to determine a disposition \nfor that report, and all allegations must be referred to the ID. \n \nIn cases where multiple A44(1) reports have been prepared against an individual concurrently \nand the MD is of the opinion that each of the inadmissibility allegations is well-founded, the MD \nshould consider the potential consequences of not referring all reports for an admissibility \nhearing (where the jurisdiction to the issue the removal order rests with the ID) at the same \ntime, including the following: \n \nin cases where multiple reports have been written for A36(1)(a) serious criminality based \non separate convictions in Canada, the fact that having a separate removal order on \neach report may be critical in ensuring that IRPA objectives are met in the event that one \nor more of the underlining convictions and/or sentences are later overturned on appeal \nby the criminal courts; \n \nabuse of process arguments may be raised at a later time if all A44(1) reports before the \nMD are not referred for an admissibility hearing at the same time.   \n \n \n22 Entering MD decisions into GCMS \n \nWhen processing or issuing an immigration document, completing an MD review, or conducting \nan examination, the MD is required to enter detailed examination or application notes into \nGCMS fully supporting the decision being made, regardless of whether the decision was \npositive or negative. \n \n \nNotes are to be factual and should not contain personal opinions which are not \nsupported by elements collected during the examination or review. The notes may \nconsist of such items as: questions and answers asked during the examination or \nreview, admissibility concerns the officer or MD may have, a synopsis of any \ndocumentation reviewed or requested, and any other pertinent details related to the \nexamination/application or MD review.

This means that in A44(2) proceedings, all necessary evidence for determining criminal \nequivalency will also need to accompany the A44(1) report.   \nIn other words, the MD must have the evidence required to determine whether the acts \ncommitted abroad and punished there would be punishable in Canada. This analysis is a \nnecessary part of the MD’s decision in order to refer the report to the ID for an admissibility \nhearing, even though the MD does not have jurisdiction to issue the removal order. \nIt is important to note that A36(1)(b) or (c) and A36(2)(b) or (c) cannot be used where the \nperson has been acquitted or a court has made a finding of not guilty. \nFor further details, see ENF 2 Evaluating Inadmissibility and ENF 3 Admissibility Hearings and \nDetention Reviews. \n23.2 Record suspensions for convictions in Canada \n \nMDs must also be careful not to rely on convictions for which a record suspension has been \ngranted as evidence of a criminal record. \n \nIn the case of convictions in Canada, the Parole Board of Canada has the authority to grant and \nissue record suspensions (formerly known as “pardons”) to persons described in A36(1)(a), and \nA36(2)(a), who have been convicted in Canada of an offence under an Act of Parliament. \n \nRecord suspension for in-Canada offences is the responsibility of the Parole Board of Canada, \nso neither deemed rehabilitation nor rehabilitation can be granted for such offences. \n \nFor more information about record suspensions, see ENF2, Evaluating inadmissibility. \n"

The \neffect of both is that they remove specific grounds of inadmissibility if certain conditions exist or \nprescribed requirements are met. \n \nUnder the D&D instruments, only certain MDs have been delegated to assess and render a \ndecision on applications for individual rehabilitation. \n \nFor further guidance on criminal rehabilitation, see ENF2 Evaluating inadmissibility. \n23.4 Offences under the Youth Criminal Justice Act \n \nA36(3)(e) exempts permanent residents and foreign nationals found guilty under the Young \nOffenders Act (YOA) or the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) from the inadmissibility \nprovisions in A36(1) and A36(2). \n \nCanadian legislation (YOA and YCJA) defines a young offender/young person as someone who \nis at least 12, but under 18 years of age. A child under the age of 12, cannot be charged with an \noffence under the Criminal Code of Canada and a person 18 years old and over would be \ncharged as an adult. \n \nThe MD must ensure that they do not rely on or refer to youth offences in any determinations \nunder A44(2), except where access is authorized under the YCJA.  Information that is not \naccessible under the provisions of the YCJA cannot be considered and must not be included or \nreferenced at any point during A44(1) or (2) proceedings. Moreover, contravention of the \nprovisions of the YCJA is a serious matter. \n \nThe importance of verifying whether information is protected by YCJA provisions was \nhighlighted in Abdi v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) 2017 FC 950. In \nthat case, the Federal Court held that while the MD did not commit an error in relying on youth \ncrimes that the applicant was found guilty of where access to these records was not restricted \nby virtue of section 119(9) of the YCJA, the MD’s reliance on youth offences that were \nwithdrawn or dismissed was unreasonable since section 119(2)(c) of the YCJA allows access to \nthese records for only a brief period after dismissal or withdrawal of the youth charges and the \naccess period to such charges had expired. \n \nOfficials conducting A44(1) and A44(2) functions must ensure that they only rely on youth \nrecords to which access is not restricted under the provisions of the YCJA.  It is therefore \nimportant for reporting officers and the MD to be aware of the provisions of the YCJA which \nrelate to access to youth records. \n \n \n \n \n"

The outcome of this hearing \ncould result in a deportation order and your permanent removal from Canada. \n \nWe trust that you understand the gravity of this matter and that we will not be required to contact you \nagain as the result of any further criminal activity. \n \n \nYours truly, \n \n \n \n(signature) \n \nName of Minister’s Delegate and title \n \n \n \n \nNote: This is a sample letter with suggested wording. Preference as to final wording, or the use of pre-\nprinted as opposed to micro-produced “originals” is left to the discretion of local managers provided the \ncontent remains consistent with the intent. \n \n \n"
