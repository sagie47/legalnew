These programs were previously referred to as alternate inspection systems (AIS). \n2. \nProgram objectives  \nAdvanced screening programs and procedures are tools that enhance the orderly flow of low-risk \ntravellers seeking entry into Canada and the United States depending on the AME program.  Pre-\nscreening programs such as CANPASS, NEXUS, Free and Secure Trade (FAST) and \nCommercial Driver Registration Program (CDRP) are available to pre-approved citizens and \npermanent residents of Canada or the U.S. Such programs are designed to expedite the entry of \nauthorized persons without having to proceed through the traditional customs and immigration \nexamination process. \nNEXUS programs and FAST stem from the Canada-United States of America Accord on Our \nShared Border (SBA) and are some of the initiatives of the Smart Border Declaration's (SBD) 32-\nPoint Plan.  More information about the SBD can be found at the following link:   \nhttp://www.dfait.gc.ca/can-am/menu-en.asp?mid=1&cat=10 \nThe CANPASS programs are initiatives under the Customs Action Plan (CAP) that are based on \na risk-assessment system that allow customs and immigration to streamline the processing of \nlow-risk travellers and focus resources on higher or unknown risks.

      "text": "ENF 29 Alternative Means of Examination Programs \n \n2005-06-17 \n \n3 \nA18(1) states:  \n18(1) Every person seeking to enter Canada must appear for an examination to \ndetermine whether that person has a right to enter Canada or is or may become \nauthorized to enter and remain in Canada.   \nThis requirement is satisfied once the person has been risk assessed by officers of the CBSA \nImmigration Processing Centre (CBSA IPC) and/or the Enrolment Centre (EC).  A15(1) \nauthorizes an officer to proceed with an examination where a person makes an application to the \nofficer.   \nR28(a) stipulates that a person makes an application in accordance with the Act by submitting an \napplication in writing. R38 provides the legislative authority for an officer to allow a person to be \nexamined by the means indicated as alternative to appearing for an examination by an officer at a \nport of entry (POE) unless otherwise directed.   \nThe CBSA customs officers are responsible for rendering decisions on the eligibility of all \napplicants to AME programs. Specifically, subsection 11.1(1) of the Customs Act states that any \nperson may be issued an authorization to present himself or herself in an alternative manner. \nCBSA immigration officers are responsible for determining the admissibility of persons applying \nfor AME programs who are foreign nationals and permanent residents of Canada.

The program combines a telephone reporting system with a pre-approval permit \nfor recreational boaters.The CANPASS Private Boats permit allows boaters, who have enrolled \nand been security cleared, the option of calling before they arrive in order to receive clearance to \nenter Canada. Travellers may declare goods by telephone and pay any applicable duties and \ntaxes by credit card. For cash payments, travellers must report to the nearest CBSA cashier.

The \nprogram is open to citizens and permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada who have \ncontinuously resided in Canada or the U.S., or a combination of both countries, for the last three \nconsecutive years. CANPASS Air allows pre-approved travellers to clear customs and \nimmigration by simply looking into a camera that recognizes the iris of their eye as proof of \nidentity. The program permits enforcement activities to be targeted elsewhere. \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/canpass/canpassair-e.html \n \nCANPASS Remote Area Border Crossing \nThe CANPASS Remote Area Border Crossing (RABC) permit is an initiative that allows the \nbearer of a permit to cross the border into Canada at certain remote areas without reporting to a \nPOE, as long as imported goods are declared. Citizens and permanent residents of the U.S. or \nCanada may apply for this permit. \nThe permit is valid for the following locations: \n• \nfrom Pigeon River through to and including Lake of the Woods;  \n• \nthe Canadian shore of Lake Superior; and \n• \nCockburn Island  \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cic.gc.ca/english/visit/rabc.html \n \nCommercial Driver Registration Program (CDRP) \nIn order to transport goods under the Customs Self Assessment (CSA) option, commercial \ncarriers and drivers must be registered and able to demonstrate a high level of compliance with \nthe laws and regulations administered by the CBSA.

For that reason, Canada and \nthe U.S. have agreed to align, to the maximum extent possible, the customs commercial \nprograms along the border. This agreement marks the creation of FAST, which is the result of a \nshared objective to enhance safety and security while enhancing the economic prosperity of both \ncountries. The program is open to citizens and permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada. \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/import/fast/menu-e.html \n \nNEXUS Highway  \nNEXUS Highway was implemented jointly by the CBSA and U.S. CBP. This program is designed \nto simplify and expedite land border crossings for pre-approved, low-risk travellers. The program \nis open to citizens and permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada who have continuously resided \nin Canada or the U.S, or a combination of these two countries, for the last three consecutive \nyears.  \nNEXUS is harmonized and bi-national, which means that participants will complete only one \nmembership application allowing entry to both Canada and the U.S.   \nMembers of the NEXUS Highway program can: \n• \nuse dedicated NEXUS lanes in Canada and the U.S. (where available);  \n• \nbenefit from simplified and expedited border crossing and entry into Canada and the U.S. as \nthey are not subject to traditional customs and immigration questioning.  \nNEXUS members may be subject to an examination at any time. \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/nexus/menu-e.html \n \nNEXUS Air \nIn 2002, Canada and the U.S. announced the creation of a bi-national working group to design \nand implement a NEXUS Air Pilot Project for air travellers. The project was implemented in \nNovember 2004 and is available at the Vancouver International Airport for the duration of the pilot. \nThe CBSA and U.S. CBP have designed NEXUS Air to facilitate passage into Canada and the \nU.S. for pre-approved, low-risk, frequent air travellers. The pilot project uses automated kiosks \nwith iris-recognition biometric technology and is open to citizens and permanent residents of the \nU.S. or Canada who have continuously resided in Canada or the U.S., or a combination of both \ncountries, for the last three consecutive years. Members of NEXUS Air will enter Canada or the \nU.S. without further interaction with customs or immigration officials, unless selected randomly for \ninspection. NEXUS Air is a bi-national initiative that builds upon the technological innovations of \nCANPASS Air. \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/nexus/menu-e.html \n"

The project allows boaters, who have enrolled and been security cleared, the option of \ncalling before they arrive in order to receive clearance to enter Canada and the U.S. Since \nNEXUS Marine is being offered as an extension to the NEXUS Highway program, applicants \nneed only complete one application to be considered for both programs. The pilot project is open \nto citizens and permanent residents of the U.S. or Canada who have continuously resided in \nCanada or the U.S., or a combination of both, for the last three consecutive years. \nNEXUS Marine Pilot Project will be in operation during the 2005 boating season. \nFor more information, see \nhttp://www.cbsa-asfc.gc.ca/travel/nexus/menu-e.html \n7. \nProcedures: CBSA Immigration Processing Centre  \n7.1. \nOverview \nThe CBSA Immigration Processing Centre forms an integral part of the risk assessment process. \nEvery person who applies to a national AME program must be approved by the CBSA Processing \nCentre (Customs) and the CBSA IPC (Immigration).  Persons who apply to a bi-national AME \nmust be approved by the CBSA and U.S. CBP. The CBSA IPCs provide security screening of \nAME applicants by completing detailed checks and reviews of various law enforcement \ndatabases. The three CBSA IPCs that operate in Canada are located in Douglas (British \nColumbia), Niagara Falls (Ontario) and Montréal (Québec).     \n7.2. \nRisk assessment \nWhile it is the CBSA immigration officer’s role to ensure that applicants who are foreign nationals \nor permanent residents are admissible to Canada, it is necessary for officers to understand the \ndifferent eligibility criteria of each program in order to make the proper recommendation to the \nCBSA PC. Officers working at the CBSA IPC are responsible for performing the following \nfunctions: \n• \nDetermine admissibility into Canada for non-Canadian citizen applicants;  \n• \nEvaluate and equate criminal offences for applicants or participants that are not Canadian \ncitizens; \n• \nReview any immigration violations associated with the applicant or participant as found in the \nFOSS records; \n• \nProvide the CBSA PC with recommendations based on program eligibility criteria when an \nimmigration violation has been associated to an application or other eligibility issues that \nhave come to the attention of the CBSA IPC. \nFor specific program requirements relating to immigration violations, please refer to the \nappropriate AME program located in Appendix A, entitled “Immigration Violations.” \n7.3. \nFOSS \nCBSA IPC officers will conduct a complete FOSS check of all applicants, including Canadian \ncitizens and permanent residents.

This includes the review of all FOSS records in the \nform of reports, orders, lookouts and all non-computer-based entries. A complete FOSS check \nmust include a review of the remarks from the history of permanent residents in order to \ndetermine whether any previous criminal convictions or immigration violations exist.  \nIn certain circumstances CBSA IPC officers will find evidence that a permanent resident may not \nhave met their residency obligation pursuant to A28. In such circumstances, officers are advised \nto follow the procedures outlined in section 7.5 below entitled “Residency obligation.”   \n7.4. \nPermanent residents \nWhile permanent residents retain the right to enter Canada under the Act, their acceptance into \nan AME program may be affected by various factors including previous immigration legislation \nviolations or criminality. This is especially important for those programs that will not accept \napplicants who have been convicted of an offence or have been found in violation of immigration \nlaw. For example, NEXUS programs have a zero-tolerance policy. \n7.5. \nResidency obligation  \nAs a permanent resident is required under section A28 to reside in Canada for 730 days in a five-\nyear period, unless otherwise exempted under that section, it may become evident during the \nprocessing of their AME application that they have not met their residency obligation. Should an \nofficer of the CBSA IPC encounter such a situation, it will be necessary to conduct further \nexamination of the applicant’s residency history prior to approval of their AME application.  \nIn the interim, the CBSA IPC officer should contact the applicant by letter and keep the \napplicant’s file “pending” for a maximum of 90 days. See Appendix B entitled “Letter requesting \nadditional information to determine admissibility and residency” for the initial letter to be sent to \nthe applicant. An NCB should also be entered into FOSS at this time by the CBSA IPC officer \nindicating that a residency determination is required.  See Appendix C entitled “Standard format \nof NCB (non-computer-based entries) in FOSS” for more information on standard FOSS remarks. \nIf a response is not received from the applicant within 30 days, the CBSA IPC will change the \nstatus of the file from “pending” to a recommendation of “fail.”  The CBSA PC must be advised of \nthe information in order to render a final decision on the application. \nPlease refer to Appendix F entitled “FOSS results form” to view the worksheet used to \ncommunicate the information to the CBSA PC. Depending on the AME program, CBSA IPC \nresults may be entered electronically by using the Global Enrolment Component (GEC) system.   \nIf the applicant responds to the letter within 30 days, the CBSA IPC officer will request that the \napplicant provide proof of their residence in order to satisfy the residency requirement. This can \nbe done via the telephone and/or in writing by sending supporting documentation by fax. If the \nCBSA IPC officer is satisfied that the applicant has met the residency obligation under A28, the \nofficer will change the status of the file from “pending” to a recommendation of “pass.”  The CBSA \nPC will be advised accordingly. \nIf the CBSA IPC officer is not satisfied that the applicant has met the residency obligation and \nadditional information is not required to make this determination, the officer may change the \nstatus of the file from “pending” to a recommendation of “fail” .The CBSA PC must be advised of \nthe information in order to render a final decision on the application.  The NCB in FOSS must be \nupdated accordingly. \nIf the CBSA IPC officer is of the opinion that the residency obligation determination requires a \nmore in-depth examination, the officer will send the applicant a second letter; see Appendix D \nentitled “Residency obligation for permanent residents.” This subsequent letter advises the \napplicant to present themselves at the nearest inland office or Canadian Consulate/ Embassy \nabroad for an interview. In such cases, the file will remain in “pending” status until a residency \ndetermination is made. \n"

See Appendix E entitled “Request for Residency Determination Form” to view \nthis form. If such a request is made by the EC, it will be necessary for the CBSA IPC officer to \ncontact the applicant using the procedures outlined above. Officers of the CBSA IPC will be \nrequired to follow up with the EC to advise them of the outcome of the residency obligation \ndetermination request.   \nIf the applicant is a permanent resident of Canada, but holds citizenship or permanent resident \nstatus in the U.S., the CBSA IPC officer should “pass” the applicant (assuming that the applicant \nis not otherwise inadmissible to Canada). It is not necessary to place these files in “pending” \nstatus since the applicant remains eligible to apply to the program regardless of whether or not \nthey meet their residency obligation in Canada. An NCB “Watch-For” must be added in FOSS to \nensure that the applicant is referred for a secondary examination the first time they use the AME \nprogram. This will provide CBSA Immigration officers with the opportunity to complete a residency \ndetermination during the secondary examination and, if applicable, have the member voluntarily \nrelinquish their Canadian permanent resident status.   \nFor further information on loss of permanent resident status, see ENF 23 Loss of permanent \nresident status at: \nhttp://www.ci.gc.ca/Manuals/immigration/enf/enf23/index_e.asp \n7.6. \nCriminality \nOfficers of the CBSA IPC are called upon to review the criminal history of all non-Canadian \napplicants. It is the responsibility of the CBSA IPC officers to determine if applicants are \nadmissible to Canada and to provide a recommendation regarding eligibility, on occasion, to the \nCBSA PC based on the applicable AME program’s criteria.   \nThe CBSA PC conducts the initial screening of applicants and subsequently provides the CBSA \nIPC officers with a printout or flags their names for further investigation. These cases can also be \nassigned electronically to the CBSA IPC officers through the Global Enrolment Component (GEC) \ndepending on the program. If information is missing, incomplete or when otherwise required, \nofficers of the CBSA IPC will conduct further database checks. \nAn application is referred or assigned for criminality by the CBSA PC in the following \ncircumstances: \n• \nApplicant may have a “hit” for CPIC wants, warrants and/or criminal history; \n• \nApplicant may have a “hit” for NCIC wants, warrants and/or criminal history;  \n• \nApplicant self-disclosed a criminal conviction on the application form for which they have not \nreceived a Canadian pardon. \nCBSA IPC officers will review the applicant’s information and compare this to the criminal history \n“hit” in order to ascertain if the person is admissible to Canada. Chapters ENF 1 and ENF 2 offer \nguidance on the inadmissibility of clients. These chapters are available at: \nhttp://www.ci.gc.ca/Manuals/immigration/enf/enf1/index_e.asp \nhttp://www.ci.gc.ca/Manuals/immigration/enf/enf2/index_e.asp \nIf a CBSA IPC officer is required to obtain further information pertaining to an applicant’s criminal \nhistory, they may contact the applicant by phone or letter in order to determine their admissibility.  \nThis letter can be found in Appendix B entitled “Letter requesting additional information to \ndetermine admissibility and residency.” The officer must ensure that privacy legislation is adhered \nto as it relates to third-party information. \n"

This letter is found at Appendix B entitled “Letter requesting additional \ninformation to determine admissibility and residency.” The officer must ensure that privacy \nlegislation is adhered to in relation to third party information.  \n7.9. \nCorrespondence from applicants \nIf the applicant responds to a request for further information within 30 days of the date of the letter \nand the CBSA IPC officer considers the person inadmissible to Canada, the officer will forward a \nrecommendation of “fail” to the CBSA PC. If an applicant responds within 30 days and a request \nis made for further information, i.e., a police record check, the applicant will be given an additional \n60 days to comply. Any further extensions will be at the discretion of the CBSA IPC officer. If the \napplicant does not respond within the 30-day time limit, the CBSA IPC officer will forward a \nrecommendation of “fail” to the CBSA PC. \nIf the applicant provides sufficient proof, through satisfactory documentation, that they are not \ninadmissible to Canada, a recommendation of “pass” will be made to the CBSA PC.   \nIf information exists that an applicant is ineligible for the program but remains admissible to \nCanada, the CBSA PC must be advised of the information in order to render a final decision.  \nNote: The applicant is still considered admissible to Canada, but a recommendation of “fail” will be \nprovided to the CBSA PC in terms of eligibility to the program.  \nSee Appendix F entitled “FOSS Results Form” to view the worksheet used to communicate the \ninformation to the CBSA PC. Depending on the AME program, the CBSA IPC results may be \nentered electronically by using the Global Enrolment Component system.  \n7.10. \nCanadian citizens \nIt is important to note the following information pertaining to Canadian citizens. \nWhile Canadian citizens retain the right to enter and remain in Canada under the Act, their \nacceptance into an AME program may be affected by various factors including previous \nimmigration legislation violations or criminality. An applicant who is a Canadian citizen may be \nineligible to participate in certain AME programs as the result of previous immigration violations. \nPlease refer to Appendix A  entitled “Immigration violations.” \nIf a criminal or immigration violation history is found in FOSS, it will be the CBSA IPC officer’s \nresponsibility to make a recommendation to the CBSA PC as to the applicant’s eligibility to join \nthe program based on that program’s criteria.

The location of ECs varies depending on the program, though they are \ngenerally located at or in close proximity to POEs at both land borders and airports.   \nAt the enrolment phase, the applicant will be required to have a digital photo of their face taken \nfor their membership card. This image will be stored in secure government databases.  \nDepending on the program, the applicant will be required to submit fingerprints which will be used \nto assess risk. Finally, the applicant will be provided with training on the relevant technology and \nprogram terms and conditions.   \n8.2. \nInterview process \nApplicants who have met the screening criteria established by the pertinent agencies will be \ncontacted regarding the next stage of the process. This phase of the process requires applicants, \nif applicable, to present themselves at the EC where they will be interviewed by an officer of the \nCBSA and/or U.S. CBP depending on the specific AME program.  \nNote: Face-to-face interviews are not required for all AME programs.   \n \nInterview scheduling \nEach program’s local working groups determine how interviews are best scheduled, based on a \nnumber of factors including client volumes, availability of resources, number of computer \nterminals, and the maximum number of clients the EC is able to accommodate at once. Walk-ins \nas well as scheduled interviews should be considered. The designation of Canada and/or U.S. \ndays may also be contemplated in order to clear a backlog. \n \nInterviewing applicants and guidelines \nWhen interviewing an applicant at the EC, it is important for officers to be aware that, prior to the \napplicant’s arrival, a thorough screening process has been conducted, including verification of \nFOSS, CPIC, PIRS, ICES, NCIC and other U.S. databases (depending on the AME program),  .  \nCBSA EC immigration officers will not be able to verify databases at the EC. Applicants will be \ninterviewed by officials of the CBSA and U.S. CBP depending on the program. Typically, CBSA \nEC immigration officers will interview applicants who are not Canadian citizens (i.e., U.S. citizens \nand resident aliens and Canadian permanent residents). CBSA EC immigration officers will verify, \nthrough questioning and the review of information, the applicant’s identity, citizenship, permanent \nresident status, residency, purpose of travel to Canada, intentions while in Canada, personal \nhistory including employment ties to Canada if any, health, and criminality.   \nThe interview provides the appropriate agencies with an opportunity to review with the applicant \nall the information provided up to this stage and to make a final determination on their: \n• \nadmissibility to both countries as appropriate; \n• \neligibility for the individual program for which an application has been submitted. \nFor further information on examination procedures, see ENF 4 at \nhttp://www.ci.gc.ca/Manuals/immigration/enf/enf4/index_e.asp \n"

In \nthese cases, since the EC officer is not in the position to perform such a lengthy interview, the \nofficer will follow the guidelines below. \nThe officer will explain to the applicant that membership in the program cannot be completed until \ntheir Canadian permanent residency obligation status has been determined by an immigration \nofficer.   \nThe CBSA immigration officer will complete the Request for Residency Determination form and \nfax it to the appropriate CBSA IPC which processed their application.

Persons applying to AME programs, with the exception of \nNEXUS programs, may be granted membership if they have been deemed rehabilitated by a \nCIC/CBSA immigration officer.  \nAdditional risk assessments should not be performed by the EC officers as all criminal records \nand customs and immigration background checks have already been completed by the \nprocessing centres. In the event that new information is obtained on an applicant that was not \npreviously disclosed or was not discovered by the processing centres, the following procedure \nmust be followed for CBSA EC immigration officers: \nThe CBSA EC immigration officer must contact the CBSA PC and notify the U.S. CBP at the EC \nthat an additional risk assessment is required.  The officer will then contact the CBSA IPC by fax \nadvising them of the disclosure or discovery of additional information. Please refer to Appendix H \nentitled “AME Security Review Form.” \n"
