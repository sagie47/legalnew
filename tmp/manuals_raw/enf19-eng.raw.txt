1. What this chapter is about 
 
This chapter describes the role of a Canada Border Service Agency (CBSA) hearings officer while 
acting as counsel at appeals heard before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the 
Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) for either the Minister of Immigration, Refugee, 
Citizenship Canada (IRCC) or the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (PSEP). 
Procedures for the preparation of an appeal, the conduct of appeal proceedings and for post- 
hearing responsibilities are all covered in this chapter. In addition, this chapter will also outline 
the program objectives, the role and jurisdiction of the IAD, the different types of IAD hearings 
and the ways in which they may be resolved are discussed. 
 
 
2. Program objectives 
 
Canada’s Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) allows specific groups of people to 
appeal to the IAD in order to: 
 
 
ensure that prescribed groups of people ordered to be removed from Canada after an 
examination or admissibility hearing have had the benefit of a full hearing on the 
allegations against them. The Act recognizes an additional commitment to permanent 
residents, protected persons and foreign nationals who hold a permanent resident visa  by 
allowing them to appeal their removal orders to the IAD, not only on the basis of legal 
and factual questions relating to the allegations at the admissibility hearing, but also on 
the basis that special considerations may be warranted; 
 
ensure that the reunion in Canada of Canadians and permanent residents with their close 
relatives from abroad is facilitated by providing a review, by way of appeal, of refusals of 
sponsored applications for permanent residence from members of the family class; and 
 
ensure that the rights of permanent residents are given due consideration by allowing an 
oral appeal to the IAD for loss of residency status determinations made both within and 
outside Canada. 
 
Pursuant to A63(5) the Minister may appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division against a 
decision of the Immigration Division (ID) in an admissibility hearing. 
 
The right of appeal to the IAD is consistent with the objectives of IRPA in that it helps to 
accomplish the following: 
 
 
ensure that families are reunited in Canada; and 
 
protect the health and safety of Canadians and maintain the security of Canadian society. 
 
 
3. The Act and Regulations 
 
The following statutory and regulatory provisions apply to appeals before the IAD.

4. Instrument of delegation and designation 
 
Except as otherwise provided in section 4 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), 
the Minister of IRCC is responsible for the administration of IRPA and the Minister of PSEP is 
responsible for the administration of IRPA as it relates to: 
 
a) examination at ports of entry; 
b) the enforcement of IRPA, including arrest, detention and removal; 
c) the establishment of policies respecting the enforcement of IRPA and inadmissibility on 
grounds of security (A34), organized criminality (A37) or violating human or international 
rights (A35); or 
d) declarations referred to in section 42.1 of the IRPA. 
 
The Minister of IRCC is responsible for appeals pertaining to visa refusal of family class 
(sponsorship appeals) and residency obligation appeals re decisions made abroad. Consequently 
the CBSA hearings officers represent the Minister of IRCC for these appeals. 
 
The Minister of PSEP is responsible for removal order appeals (including for residency obligation 
appeals re in-Canada decisions) and Ministerial appeals against a decision by the IRB 
Immigration Division in an admissibility hearing. The CBSA hearings officers represent the 
Minister of PSEP for these appeals. 
 
The Minister of IRCC has delegated to the CBSA hearings officers the authority to make an 
application for non-disclosure of information during an appeal before the IAD made under 
subsections 63(1) and 63(4) of the IRPA (Item 121 in the June 2017 Instrument). 
 
The Minister of PSEP has delegated to the CBSA Manager of the Judicial Review Unit and the IRCC 
Director of Litigation Management the authority to appeal under 63(5). 


===== PAGE 16 =====
22 August 2024  
 
Refer to IL 3, Designation of Officers and Delegation of Authority, for IRCC and the CBSA. 
 
 
5. Departmental policy 
 
Under section 167 of the IRPA the Minister (whichever Minister that may be according to the 
areas of responsibility articulated in section 4 of the IRPA) may be represented by legal or other 
counsel. Prior to the creation of the CBSA, IRCC officers represented the Minister before the IAD. 
Legal assistance or personal attendance by a Government lawyer at a hearing was, when 
required, provided by the Department of Justice (DOJ). 
 
With the creation of the CBSA, the responsibility to represent the Minister before the IAD was 
passed from IRCC officers to the CBSA hearings officers. 
 
There will be rare circumstances where the assistance of a DOJ lawyer may be required. Such 
assistance will usually be in the form of consultation and advice to the hearings officer however 
personal attendance by the Government lawyer to present legal arguments is also possible. 
 
5.1. Officer safety and security 
 
If an officer perceives a threat to their safety prior to a hearing, they should immediately 
inform their manager and communicate those concerns to the IRB. The officer should 
communicate their safety and security concerns to the IRB by using the form entitled 
“Identification of Potential Security Risk in IRB Proceedings”. If time does not permit, the IRB 
could be alerted of the security concern verbally and the form submitted as soon as possible. The 
IRB security unit will conduct a risk assessment to determine if additional security measures 
should be implemented. In certain circumstances, depending on the safety and security concerns 
and location of the scheduled hearing, it may be more appropriate for hearings officers to file an 
application to request a change of hearing location. A164 provides that whether an IAD hearing 
is to be conducted in the presence of the person who is subject to the proceedings or by means 
of live telecommunication is in the division’s discretion. 
 
Situations may arise during a hearing in which an officer feels their personal safety or the 
safety of others is being compromised. When an officer feels their safety has been threatened, 
such as in situations of intimidation by witnesses, the uttering of threats or other safety 
concerns, they should immediately bring the matter to the attention of the presiding member 
first and then their manager at the earliest opportunity, and take any necessary measure within 
reason to protect their own safety according to the IRB protocol. 
 
IRB procedures for safety and security should help prevent such situations and provide guidance 
for managing them if they do arise. See Appendix A Detention Safety and Security Annex. 
 
5.2. Incident report writing 
 
Where an incident occurs before, or during, a hearing where an officer feels their safety has been 
threatened, they should complete an incident report. Reporting procedures enable the CBSA to 


===== PAGE 17 =====
22 August 2024  
 
 
make important decisions regarding the safety and security of staff, ongoing training needs, and 
the recognition of exemplary performance in difficult situations. 
 
 
6. Definitions 
 
The hearing process 
Immigration Appeal 
Division (IAD) 
The IAD is an administrative tribunal that provides an independent 
review of decisions made under the immigration program where a right 
of appeal exists. The IAD examines cases before it for possible errors 
in law, in fact, and mixed law and fact, or for failure to observe a 
principle of natural justice. It also has the authority to reverse valid 
decisions on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. This Division is 
part of the IRB and is completely independent of the IRCC, the PSEP 
and their respective Ministers. 
A174 states that the IAD is a court of record. It conducts public 
hearings on the basis of the adversary system and established judicial 
principles, rules and precedents. The IAD has all the powers, rights and 
privileges vested in a superior court of record with respect to any 
matter necessary for the exercise of its jurisdiction, including the 
swearing and examination of witnesses, the production and inspection 
of documents, and the enforcement of its orders. 
The matters that may be brought before the IAD are: 
 
refusal to issue a visa to a member of the family class A63(1); 
 
removal orders made against foreign nationals who hold 
permanent resident visas A63(2); 
 
removal orders made against permanent residents and 
protected persons at an examination or admissibility hearing 
A63(3) ; 
 
appeals of overseas decisions on loss of permanent resident 
status A63(4); and 
 
Minister’s appeal of a decision made by a member of the 
Immigration Division A63(5). 
Humanitarian and 
compassionate 
considerations 
The IAD has an equitable jurisdiction, which allows it to consider 
factors that may warrant an appeal being allowed despite the fact the 
decision is valid in law. IRPA sets out the test to be applied by the IAD 
in order to allow a case for reasons of equity. Under IRPA, the test of 
equity, which the IAD is to apply, has been consolidated into one test 
for all types of appeals to the IAD by a party other than the Minister. 
A67(1)(c) states that the IAD must be satisfied that, at the time the 
appeal is disposed of “…taking into account the best interests of a child 


===== PAGE 18 =====

directly affected by the decision, sufficient humanitarian and 
compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the 
circumstances of the case." 
The IAD will balance factors such as those set out below against the 
grounds for the removal order or refusal under appeal if it finds in 
favour of the appellant, it will set aside the decision. In the case of an 
appeal regarding an application based on membership in the family 
class, the IAD must first be satisfied that the foreign national is a 
member of the family class and the sponsor is a sponsor within the 
meaning of the Regulations before it can consider humanitarian and 
compassionate considerations [A65]. Minister of Public Safety and 
Emergency Preparedness v. Hagos, IMM 6378-11, April 20, 2012]. 
Factors to be considered by the IAD in appeals of removal orders 
include: 
 
the seriousness of the offence leading to the removal order, 
where applicable; 
 
the possibility of rehabilitation, where applicable; 
 
the length of time spent in Canada and the degree to which the 
appellant is established here; 
 
the family in Canada and the dislocation to the family that the 
deportation would cause; 
 
the support available to the appellant, not only within the 
family but also within the community; 
 
the degree of hardship that would be caused to the appellant by 
their return to their country of nationality, provided that the 
likely country of removal has been established by the appellant 
on a balance of probabilities. 
These factors have been established by the Immigration Appeal 
Commission in Ribic v. Canada (Minister of Employment and 
Immigration), [1985] I.A.B.D. No. 4 (QL). The Supreme Court of 
Canada in Chieu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, 
[2002] 1 S.C.R. 84 at paragraph 90, reaffirmed that “The factors set 
out in Ribic, [supra], remain the proper ones for the IAD to consider 
during an appeal...” 
When considering a family class appeal, some of the factors that may 
be considered by the IAD include: 
 
whether authorizing the applicant to enter would result in the 
reunion in Canada of the appellant with close family; 
 
the strength of the relationship between the applicant and the 
appellant; 


===== PAGE 19 =====
22 August 2024  
 
 
 
the degree to which the applicant is established abroad; 
 
whether an applicant has demonstrated the potential to adapt 
to Canadian society; 
 
whether the parties to the application have obligations to one 
another based on their cultural background; 
 
whether the applicant is alone in their country; 
 
the availability of health services to the applicant in Canada and 
abroad (for refusals based on medical grounds); 
 
whether there is evidence of rehabilitation or the risk of the 
applicant re-offending (for refusals based on criminal grounds). 
Hearings 
IAD hearings are de novo and therefore not limited strictly to reviewing 
the evidence that led up to the refusal or removal order. In Kahlon v. 
Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), (1989) 7 Imm. 
L.R. (2d) 91; 97 N.R. 349 (F.C.A.), the Federal Court of Appeal 
established that the IAD must hear the whole case and consider any 
additional facts brought to its attention. 
Evidence 
The IAD has broader powers regarding the admission of evidence than 
regular courts since it is not bound by any legal or technical rules of 
evidence [A175(1)c)]. During a hearing, the IAD may receive, and 
base a decision, on evidence it considers credible or trustworthy in the 
circumstances, even if the strict rules of evidence have not been met 
by either party to the proceedings. 
Decisions 
The IAD may dispose of an appeal by allowing it or dismissing it. In the 
case of an appeal against a removal order, the IAD may also direct 
that the enforcement of the order be stayed for a set period of time, 
with conditions attached [A68]. Stays are sometimes granted by the 
IAD in cases where the residency obligation has not been complied 
with. These stays can be seen in files where a removal order has been 
issued at a port of entry but can also apply to cases against a decision 
made outside Canada on the residency obligation when a member 
authorizes their return to Canada for their hearing. IRPA requires the 
IAD to impose mandatory conditions specified in R251 as well as any 
other conditions that it considers necessary. The IAD can reconsider a 
decision to stay a removal order at any time. A reconsideration  of a 
stay may be initiated either by application by the appellant or the 
Minister’s counsel or on the IAD’s own initiative. [IAD rule 78 & 79] 
Where the Minister is successful in appealing a favourable decision 
made by the Immigration Division, the IAD may make or stay the 
removal order that the member of the Immigration Division did not 
make. 


===== PAGE 20 =====
22 August 2024  
 
 
A decision that is delivered orally at a hearing takes effect when the 
member states the decision. A decision made in writing takes effect 
when the member signs and dates the decision [IAD rule 104]. 
Reasons 
The IAD is required to provide written reasons for all decisions 
regarding an appeal by a sponsor and for decisions that stay a removal 
order. For all other decisions, the person concerned or the Minister of 
IRCC or Minister of PSEP may request written reasons [IAD rule 103]. 
 
 
7. Procedure: General hearing 
 
7.1. Calculating time limits 
 
The Interpretation Act governs the calculation of time limits in federal statutes, regulations and 
rules: 
 
Pursuant to subsection 27(2) of the Interpretation Act, when a statute refers to a number of 
days (not clear days) between two events, officers will exclude the day on which the first event 
happened and include the day on which the second event is to occur. When the time limit for the 
performance of a required action expires or falls on a holiday, the action may be performed on 
the next workday after the holiday. Pursuant to sections 26 and 35 of the Interpretation Act, 
Sundays are holidays, Saturdays are not. 
 
For example, if there is a 15-day limit to appeal a decision made on June 2, the count begins on 
June 3 and ends on June 17. Holidays are not left out in counting up to the 15th day. June 17 
would therefore be the last day to file, unless it were a Sunday, in which case, June 18 would be 
the last day. If June 17 is a Saturday and the office is closed, then the appeal must be filed on 
June 16. 
 
7.2. Withdrawing an appeal (IAD rule 94) 
 
An appellant may apply in writing to the IAD to withdraw their appeal. Should the IAD determine 
that withdrawing the appeal would likely have a negative effect on the integrity of the IAD 
Division, it may determine that the withdrawal is an abuse of process and refuse to allow the 
appellant to withdraw their appeal. 
 
If an appeal is withdrawn before the record is prepared or distributed, it is not necessary to 
distribute the record. 
 
When a decision is received from the IAD indicating that an appeal has been withdrawn, the 
Global Case Management System (hereinafter “GCMS”) “Appeals” screen and National Case 
Management System (NCMS) should be updated by the hearings officer. 


===== PAGE 21 =====
22 August 2024  
 
 
7.3. Reinstating an appeal after withdrawal (IAD rule 95-96) 
 
An appellant may apply to the IAD to reinstate an appeal that has been withdrawn. The 
application must conform to the IAD Rules for applications and include the appellant’s address 
and telephone number. The IAD may reinstate the appeal if it is satisfied that it failed to observe 
a principle of natural justice or that it is in the interest of justice to do so [IAD rule 96]. 
 
If an appeal is reinstated by the IAD, the decision must be entered in GCMS and NCMS by the 
hearings officer. 
 
7.4. Proof document was provided (IAD rule 25) 
 
A written statement stating how and when the documents were provided to the other party must 
accompany all applications, documents and records of appeal filed with the IAD. A sample 
statement of service is attached in Appendix D. 
 
7.5. Applications to reopen an appeal 
 
A foreign national who has not left Canada under a removal order may make an application to 
the IAD to reopen their appeal. The IAD may grant the application and reopen the appeal only if 
it is satisfied that it failed to observe a principle of natural justice [A71]. 
 
The IAD does not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal once the deportation order has been 
executed. [Corpuz Ledda v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 14; Ramkissoon v 
Canada (MCI); [1978] 2 FC 290 (FCA); Canada (MCI) v Toledo, [2000] 3 FCR 563 (FCA). The 
powers conferred upon IAD under IRPA (sections 66-69, 71) with respect to removal order 
appeals refer to possible action before the enforcement of the deportation order. The IRPA does not 
confer power for the IAD to take any action in cases where the deportation order has been enforced. 
As such, the IAD does not have jurisdiction to re-open an appeal if the foreign national who filed an 
application to re-open has been removed before their application is determined by the IAD. 
 
Hearings officers should strongly oppose any application to reopen unless they are satisfied there 
was a breach of natural justice that merits the appeal being reopened. Hearings officers should 
file a motion on the ground that the IAD has no jurisdiction against any application to reopen 
where the foreign national has already been removed from Canada. 
 
Please note the following section of operation bulletin PRG-2017-67 as it pertains to attempts to 
re-open appeal hearings: 
 
Attempts based on Tran (Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 
SCC 50), 2017 SCC 50) to reopen final ID or IAD decisions where a determination of 
inadmissibility has been made, a removal order issued, and all avenues of appeal and/or judicial 
review exhausted can be opposed by the hearings officers on the basis of the doctrine of res 
judicata. The purpose of the Operational Bulletin (hereinafter “OB”) is to direct the regions to  use 
res judicata in the present context where the law has changed and where we do not want all 


===== PAGE 22 =====
22 August 2024  
 
 
individuals who received valid removal orders at the time they were issued to re-litigate post 
Tran. 
 
7.6. Applications 
 
The IAD Rules specify that unless the IAD Rules provide otherwise, requests made to the IAD 
must be made in an application in writing [IAD rule 84,85]. Applications may also be made 
orally at a proceeding. Procedures for applications made orally at an appeal will be determined 
by the IAD at the proceeding. 
 
Applications made in writing must: 
 
 
state the decision that the applicant wants the IAD to make; 
 
give reasons why the IAD should make the decision; 
 
state whether the other party agrees to the application; and 
 
include any evidence that the applicant wants the IAD to consider when it renders its 
decision. 
 
Evidence included with an application must be in the form of a statutory declaration or affidavit 
[IAD rule  85(3)]. This rule, however, does not apply to applications to change the location of a 
hearing or the date or time of a hearing or applications to reconsider the appeal, where a stay of 
removal has previously been granted. 
 
Written applications must first be provided to the other party and then filed at the IAD registry 
with a written statement indicating how and when the other party w as provided with the 
application. The sample statement of service (Appendix D) may be used to meet the proof of 
service requirement. 
 
Some examples of requests that must be made by way of application are: 
 
 
requests to change the location of a proceeding IAD rule 88(1); 
 
requests for non-disclosure of information (A86) 
 
requests to change the date or time of a proceeding IAD rule  90; 
 
requests to change or extend time limits; 
 
requests to hold a hearing in the absence of the public IAD rule  93; and 
 
requests to withdraw or reinstate an appeal IAD rules94,95. 
 
Responses to written applications must be in writing [IAD rule 86(1) ]. A written response must 
include the same information as noted above for the application. The response must be filed with 
the IAD no later than seven days after the respondent receives the application [IAD rule 86(5)  
An applicant may reply in writing to the response no later than five days after they have received 
the response. [IAD rule 87(3) ]. 
 
When an application is received, it should be reviewed to determine whether it has merit and 
warrants the Minister’s consent or should be opposed. 


===== PAGE 23 =====
22 August 2024  
 
 
When an application is filed or received, the “Application” screen of NCMS should be completed 
by the hearings officer showing that an application has been initiated. All events in the 
application process should be entered into NCMS. 
 
7.7. Loss of appeal rights 
 
A64 specifies the circumstances under which a foreign national, their sponsor or a permanent 
resident loses their right of appeal. If a foreign national or permanent resident is determined by 
an officer or the Immigration Division to be inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human 
or international rights, serious criminality or organized criminality, they do not have a right to 
appeal to the IAD. 
 
Serious criminality—Term of imprisonment of 6 months or more for a crime that was 
punished in Canada or crime described in paragraph A36(1)(b) or (c) [A64(2)]. 
 
In order for the loss of appeal rights to apply on grounds of serious criminality, the person must 
have received a sentence of 6 months or more for a crime punished in Canada or must have 
been found inadmissible for a crime described in A36(1)(b) or (c). In cases where there has been 
time served, i.e., pre-sentence custody, the officer must verify the credit given by the criminal 
court sentencing judge for the pre-sentence custody by reviewing the criminal court transcript as 
time spent in pre-trial detention may form part of a term of imprisonment for the purpose of 
A64(2). Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Atwal, 2004 FC 7. It is important 
that officers gather information as to the actual sentence served. When calculating the total 
sentence imposed, it is imperative that the sentence be calculated to the day and not rounded 
off to the month as the repercussion of meeting the 6 months threshold is the loss of a right of 
appeal. (R. v. Wust, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 455, 2000 SCC 18, para. 44 and 45). A sentence of 6 
months is considered 183 days of imprisonment. 
 
A64(2) is not meant to include multiple, consecutive sentences. It refers to only a single 
sentence. As a result of the SCC decision in Tran, a conditional sentence order is not considered 
a term of imprisonment for the purposes of A64(2) [Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and 
Emergency Preparedness), 2017 SCC 50]. 
 
Misrepresentation 
 
If a sponsored application for permanent residence is rejected based on a finding of 
inadmissibility on grounds of misrepresentation, there is no right of appeal. However, this 
provision does not apply if the foreign national is the sponsor’s spouse, common-law partner or 
child [A64(3)]. 
 
7.8. Non-disclosure of information: Prior to an appeal hearing 
 
There exists some information in the possession of the Minister that should not be disclosed to 
the IAD or to the other party. Different sources of information may be received by the public, the 
applicant, the sponsor, law enforcement, or other government departments. 


===== PAGE 24 =====
22 August 2024  
 
 
The methods available to the Minister to protect this information include: 
 
 
a valid privilege over the information (common law public interest privilege, informer 
privilege) 
 
an application for non-disclosure (A86) 
 
the security certificate regime (A77) 
 
redacting irrelevant portions of a document 
 
not relying on a document (when the Minister is not under an obligation to disclose all 
information) 
 
For the purposes of the production of an appeal record, the Minister must first determine if the 
tip needs to be included in the record. Then, the Minister must take steps to determine if the tip 
needs to be redacted from the appeal record and finally, decide on which method is best suited 
to protect this information. 
 
For guidelines on non-disclosure of information [A86] and protecting information, see ENF 31 
and the Hearings Fundamentals Manual. 
 
7.9. Non-disclosure of information: During an appeal hearing 
 
 
should the Minister’s counsel present a written application for the non-disclosure of 
information [A86], the IAD member adjourns the hearing. The IAD member determines 
whether section 86 proceedings apply. 
 
For guidelines on non-disclosure of information [A86] and protecting information, see ENF 31. 
 
7.10. Pre-hearing conferences 
 
When officers enter into an undertaking with counsel and the IAD at a pre-hearing conference, it 
must be detailed in writing on the file. For example, if the Minister’s counsel agrees on a 
statement of facts, concedes on certain issues or undertake to take specific actions, it must be 
clearly noted on file. 
 
Where one officer has entered into an undertaking, any officer who subsequently has 
responsibility for that appeal is bound by the undertaking made by the previous officer unless 
new information supports a change in position. 
 
7.11. Liaison with the Department of Justice 
 
IRCC and the CBSA’s Legal Services must be the primary source of legal advice to IRCC and the 
CBSA respectively to ensure uniform advice and to keep IRCC and the CBSA senior officials 
informed of new or unexpected issues. 
 
The office concerned should inform the Hearings Program as early as possible of appeals 
involving important Charter questions or issues that could have a potentially serious impact on 
the immigration program and the interpretation of the legislation. IRCC or the 


===== PAGE 25 =====
22 August 2024  
 
 
CBSA will consult Legal Services to decide if assigning a Department of Justice lawyer to the case 
is warranted. 
 
When the hearings officer requires urgent assistance in relation to an upcoming IAD hearing, 
they should consult their Justice Liaison Officer (JLO) who may request the assignment of 
counsel by contacting the Legal Issues Coordination Group (LICG) at 
LICG_Litigation_Assignments@justice.gc.ca with a copy to the Hearings Program (Hearings- 
Audiences-Programs@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca), and the CBSA Judicial Review Unit (JRU) (CBSA-
ASFC_SecurityLitigationManagement-Gestiondeslitigessécurité <SLM-GLS@CBSA-
ASFC.GC.CA>) for questions under the responsibility of the Minister of PSEP or the Hearings 
Program and the IRCC Litigation Management Branch (LMB) for questions under the 
responsibility of the Minister of IRCC. 
 
7.12. Applications for judicial review 
 
Where the officer who represents the Minister before a Division of the IRB believes that there are 
or may be grounds to seek judicial review, the officer will immediately consult their manager or 
the regional CBSA Justice Liaison Officer, subject to local procedures, to discuss the possibility of 
seeking judicial review of the decision. If the manager agrees that judicial review should be 
pursued, the hearings officer must do the following: 
 
(a) immediately request the reasons for decision from the Board; and 
(b) within five business days of the decision, determination, order, etc., being made, send, 
through the regional CBSA Justice Liaison Officer, a report to the Director of Litigation 
Management Branch (LMB) at IRCC or the Manager of Judicial Review (JRU) at the 
CBSA. The report is to be transmitted by electronic means. 
 
Officers should also keep in mind the very strict time limits involved when seeking judicial 
review. The 15 days for serving and filing the leave application with respect to a decision of the 
Board is calculated from the giving of notice of the decision or from the sending of written 
reasons, whichever is later pursuant to A169(f). 
 
In order for NHQ to correctly calculate the date for filing, the request for judicial review must 
clearly indicate the date that IRCC or the CBSA became aware of the decision and the date the 
decision was sent by the Board. Once IRCC LMB or the CBSA JRU agrees to seek judicial review, 
immediate instructions will be issued to the Department of Justice to file the appropriate 
documentation with the Court. Should IRCC LMB or the CBSA JRU disagree with the 
recommendation for judicial review, IRCC or the CBSA office will be provided with a rationale for 
their decision. The rationale can be provided by JRU/LMB or the JLO depending on the reasons 
and discussions can take place to clarify certain points. 
 
Note: In situations where an application is required to be filed with the Court on an urgent basis 
in order to preserve the Minister’s rights, the decision to seek judicial review may be made at the 
regional level. The IRCC Director of LMB or the CBSA Manager of JRU will be notified as soon as 
possible thereafter. Officers should refer such requests to the regional CBSA Justice Liaison 
Officer after they have obtained concurrence from their manager.

Note: See ENF 9, Judicial Review, for further information. 
 
 
7.13 Post hearing procedures 
 
When the hearings office concerned receives notice of the IAD’s decision and reasons, the GCMS 
and NCMS “Appeals” screens are to be completed promptly. 
 
If the IAD allows the appeal and the hearings officer, in consultation with their supervisor and 
Justice Liaison Officer, believes that an application for leave and judicial review of the decision is 
warranted the hearings office should follow the procedures for the Judicial review outlined in 
7.12. 
 
If the C&I Minister applies for leave to begin an application for judicial review of the IAD decision 
allowing a sponsorship appeal, further processing of the visa application by the officer is stayed 
until the leave and judicial review application are disposed of by the courts (Federal Court 
Federal Court of Appeal and or/ the Supreme Court). If leave is granted, further processing of 
the visa application is stayed until the courts have finally disposed of the matter, or until the 
time limits for filing the application for judicial review or appeal have elapsed. 
 
If the IAD allows the appeal, refers the matter back for reconsideration and the Minister does not 
file an application for leave to apply for judicial review of the decision, the case is returned to the 
responsible IRCC office for reconsideration in accordance with the IAD’s decision [A70(1)]. 
 
For sponsorship appeals, in addition to uploading the decision and reasons into GCMS, the 
hearings office should also include any new evidence that was established at the hearing. If the 
Minister consented to the appeal, the IRCC office is given a full explanation of the reasons for the 
Minister’s consent. 
 
A70(1) obliges an officer to respect the decision of the IAD in re-examining an application. 
However, the officer must review the application to determine whether the application meets all 
other requirements of eligibility and admissibility. Sponsors and applicants are exempt from any 
requirements that the IAD has set aside in its decision. In rare cases, if there are new grounds of 
ineligibility or inadmissibility, or grounds that were not assessed in the first decision, the 
application may be refused again. 
 
Note: To ensure that IRCC offices do not process applications where an application for judicial 
review has been made on sponsorship appeals, hearings offices must inform IRCC that an 
application for judicial review of the IAD decision is pending

8. Procedure: Family class sponsorship appeals 
 
IRCC has the policy responsibility for family class sponsorship and the Minister of IRCC is the 
respondent (as of today the official name of the Ministry had not changed to IRCC and as such 
until it does change, the style of cause is to remain Minister of Citizenship and Immigration). 
 
8.1. Family class sponsorship appeals 
 
If a Canadian citizen or permanent resident files an application to sponsor a foreign national as a 
member of the family class, and the application for a visa is refused, the sponsor may appeal the 
refusal of the application to the IAD [A63(1)]. The sponsor must be informed of the reasons for 
the refusal and of the right of appeal to the IAD. 
 
There is no right of appeal to the IAD if the foreign national (applicant) is inadmissible on the 
following grounds [A64(1), (2) and (3)]: 
 
 
security, violating human or international rights;
 
serious criminality with respect to a crime that was punished in Canada by a term of 
imprisonment of at least 6 months or a crime that is described in paragraph 36(1)(b) or 
(c);
 
organized crime; or
 
misrepresentation [unless the foreign national in question is the sponsor’s spouse, 
common-law partner or child A64(3)].
 
Details regarding loss of appeal rights and exceptions can be found in section 7.7 above. 
 
8.2. Notice of appeal 
 
To file an appeal to the IAD under IRPA, the sponsor must submit a notice of appeal and the 
officer’s written reasons for refusal to the IAD registry no later than 30 days after the appellant 
received the reasons for the refusal of the application [IAD rule 16(a)] 
 
The IAD will then provide the notice of appeal and written reasons for refusal to CBSA who 
represents the Minister of IRCC in sponsorship appeals. 
 
8.3. Designated representative 
 
If counsel for the appellant or Minister believes the IAD should designate a representative for the 
subject of the appeal because they are under 18 years of age or unable to appreciate the nature 
of the proceedings, they must notify the IAD in writing. If counsel is aware of a person in Canada 


===== PAGE 28 =====
22 August 2024  
 
 
who meets the requirements to be designated as a representative, they must provide the 
person’s contact information in the notice of appeal [IAD rule 43,44(1)] 
 
8.4. Grounds for appeal 
 
An appeal to the IAD may be based on questions of law, fact, or mixed law and fact, a principle of 
natural justice has not been observed or on the grounds that there are humanitarian and 
compassionate considerations that warrant granting special relief under its equitable jurisdiction. 
The definition of “humanitarian and compassionate considerations” in section 6 above elaborates 
on the IAD’s equitable jurisdiction. 
 
If the IAD determines that the applicant is not a member of the family class or that their sponsor 
is not a sponsor within the meaning of the Regulations pursuant to R130 or R117, it cannot 
exercise its equitable jurisdiction to consider humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) factors 
[A65]. In other words, the IAD cannot consider H&C factors unless it is satisfied that the 
applicant is a member of the family class or the sponsor meets the requirements of the 
regulations. If an IRCC officer refused the application without deciding if the applicant is a 
member of the family class, the IAD cannot consider H&C without first making a determination 
on whether the applicant is indeed a member of the family class. For example, in the context of a 
spousal application the IAD would have to be satisfied that the marriage is legally valid and the 
relationship is genuine (R4) [Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness v. Hagos, 
IMM 6378-11, April 20, 2012]. 
 
In the absence of a determination made by an IRCC officer on whether the applicant is a 
member of the family class, it is up to the IAD to consider the issue for the first time during the 
appeal, however this is not the best option. The hearing may be postponed to permit the 
hearings officer to reach out the visa office and request that they assess the relationship (OB 
396). 
 
8.5. Disputed appeal rights 
 
When a refusal is based on a determination that the sponsor has not filed their application in the 
prescribed manner as set out in R10, then an application to dismiss the appeal should be made 
to the IAD. Hearings officers should argue that the IAD does not have jurisdiction to hear the 
appeal because the sponsor has not made an application under the Act pursuant to R10. The 
issue of whether or not the sponsor is entitled to appeal to the IAD will be decided by the IAD. 
 
8.6. Preparation of the record 
 
The IAD will notify the responsible IRRC office that an appeal has been filed and will request 
that their file be forwarded to the CBSA Hearings office. The IAD will copy the CBSA hearings 
office with this request. Once the IRCC office has received the notice of an appeal, it will send 
the IRCC  sponsorship file to the applicable CBSA hearings office as soon as possible. 
 
Upon receiving the notice of appeal and the file, the hearings office should:

ensure that the GCMS and NCMS “Appeals” screens are completed promptly;
 
enter any motions or applications associated with the appeal in the GCMS and NCMS.
 
 
prepare the record, ensuring the documentation is complete and that it is legible and 
suitable for presentation to the IAD. IAD rule 20(1) states that a record shall contain 
a table of contents and the following documents:
o 
the application for a permanent resident visa that has been refused; 
o 
the application for sponsorship and the sponsor’s undertaking; 
o 
any document that the Minister has that is relevant to the application, to the 
reasons for the refusal or to any other issue in the appeal; and 
o 
the written reasons for the refusal. 
 
Note: Under IRPA, the IRCC officer is no longer required to prepare a statutory declaration. 
However, officers are required to record the rationale for their decision and this must be 
included in the record. 
 
The CBSA hearings office must provide the appeal record to the appellant or their counsel and a 
copy to the IAD. The copy of the appeal record provided to the IAD must be accompanied by a 
written statement saying how and when the appeal record was provided to the appellant [IAD 
rule 21(1) and (2)]. 
 
Records must be received by the IAD no later than 60 days after the Minister receives a 
copy of the written request from the Division to IRCC for the sponsorship file [IAD rule 
22(a)]. 
 
 
If the IAD has not received the record within  60 days , it may take one of the following 
measures: 
 
 
require the Minister  to explain why the appeal record is late and give reasons 
why the appeal record should be accepted late; or
 
schedule and start the hearing and decide the appeal without the appeal record 
or with only part of the appeal record.
 
Note: It is important that a hearings officer review the IRCC office file immediately after receipt. 
This review will allow officers to identify problems and opportunities to resolve the case without a 
hearing. Furthermore, early review of the visa file will allow the opportunity to add additional 
grounds of refusal if necessary. 
 
8.7. Requirements to be eligible to sponsor 
 
R130 to R134 provide the requirements that a person must meet to be eligible to sponsor a 
relative as a member of the family class. The Family Class Program Delivery Instructions (PDIs) 
on assessing the sponsor provide further information on the legislative requirements to be met 
by the sponsor.

8.8. Failure to meet financial criteria 
 
R134 provides procedures for calculating a sponsor’s ability to meet the minimum necessary 
income (MNI) requirement. Financial requirements are specific to the type of family member 
being sponsored. 
 
Assessment of ability to meet this requirement for the sponsorship of a family member is based 
on the last notice of assessment or equivalent document. Where the sponsor does not produce 
the document or their income is less than the required amount, their income will be calculated 
based on the income during the 12 months preceding the application. The date of the application 
is the date on which a complete family class application, including the processing fees, has been 
received at the CPC-Mississauga. Under R133(4), a sponsor is exempt from meeting MNI 
requirements when they are sponsoring a spouse or partner or dependent child.  
 
Amendments to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations that came into force on 
January 1, 2014, made changes to the financial requirements for parents and grandparents. For 
the sponsorship of parents and grandparents, the sponsor must meet the minimum necessary 
income requirement (Low Income Cut-offs (LICOs) plus 30%) for each of the three taxation 
years immediately preceding the date of their application. The Minimum Necessary Income must 
meet or exceed the minimum necessary income requirement plus 30% on the date on which the 
sponsorship application is signed until the day the family members are granted status as 
permanent residents. 
 
The ruling in the decision Nematollahi v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2017 FC 755 has 
led the IRCC to review its interpretation of the Regulations concerning the three consecutive 
taxation years immediately preceding the date the application to sponsor is received. The ruling 
has an impact on applications to sponsor parents and grandparents that have been received 
since 2014. Sponsors are encouraged to sign the statement of consent (question 8 on the 
Financial Evaluation for Parents and Grandparents Sponsorship) and provide their Social 
Insurance Number (SIN) to allow the IRCC to collect their SIN and request their income tax 
information quickly from Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) to determine whether they meet the 
minimum necessary income requirements. This may be used in cases where the sponsor has 
submitted their application to sponsor at the beginning of the year and may not have filed their 
taxes at the time of application or have still not received their Notice of Assessment for the 
previous taxation year. If the sponsor does not provide their consent, they must complete the 
applicable form Income Sources for the Sponsorship of Parents and Grandparents and submit a 
Notice of Assessment issued to them by the CRA for each of the three taxation years 
immediately preceding the date their application is received by the IRCC. If the sponsor does not 
have paper copies of their Notices of Assessment on file, they may view and print their tax 
returns as well as other personal tax information using the CRA’s My Account online service. 
 
Subsection 134(2) of IRPR provides officers with the authority to request updated evidence of 
income from all sponsors who submit a sponsorship application for a member of the family class 
in the following circumstances: 


===== PAGE 31 =====
22 August 2024  
 
 
 
the officer receives information indicating that the sponsor is no longer able to fulfil the 
obligations of the sponsorship undertaking; or
 
more than 12 months have elapsed since the receipt of the sponsorship application.
 
Appellants may submit new evidence of income relating to the period preceding the date of filing 
of their sponsorship application. In such cases, officers are required to take into account the new 
evidence of income in determining the IRCC’s position at the appeal hearing. 
 
However, officers should argue that evidence of income relating to the period that follows the 
receipt of the sponsorship application is not a valid indication of a sponsor’s ability to meet the 
requirements in R134 for authorization to sponsor. The IAD should not take such evidence into 
account in deciding on the basis of a question of fact or law. Where the sponsor’s financial 
situation has improved, the option to submit a new sponsorship application is available. 
 
The ruling in the decision of Dokaj v. Canada (2009, FC847) has led the IRCC to review its 
interpretation of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations concerning the adding of a 
co-signer to an existing family class undertaking. The Federal Court found that the IRCC could 
not take into account the additional expenses incurred when adding a family member to the 
household, such as a spouse or common-law partner, without also taking into consideration the 
income that the individual brings to the household, if they have co-signed an undertaking. 
Henceforth, a co-signer can be added between the day on which the sponsorship application was 
filed and the day on which a decision is made with respect to the application, if required, due to 
a change in circumstances related to family composition. When assessing the sponsor’s income 
against the MNI requirement, both the increase in the MNI requirements resulting from the 
addition of a family member, and the co-signer’s income, calculated in accordance with R134(a) 
to (c) against the MNI in effect at the time, shall be considered. However, a co-signer may not 
be added to the sponsorship application if the sponsorship was already assessed and at that 
assessment, the sponsor failed to meet the sponsorship requirements. 
 
8.9. Other sponsorship eligibility requirements 
 
Sponsors are not eligible to sponsor if they are convicted of a sexual or violent offence against 
anyone, or for an attempt or a threat to commit such an offence, or if they are convicted of an 
offence causing bodily harm against certain members of their family, or for an attempt or a 
threat to commit such an offence [R133(1)(e)]. 
 
In addition, the sponsorship application shall only be approved if there is evidence that the 
sponsor is not in receipt of social assistance for a reason other than disability [R133(1)(k)]. 
 
See the PDI on Permanent Residence , Family classes, Processing Applications to 
Sponsor Members of the Family Class, for further information concerning the 
processing of applications to sponsor. 
 
8.10. Humanitarian and compassionate grounds related to sponsorship 
 
If the IAD determines that the applicant is a member of the family class pursuant to R117 and 


===== PAGE 32 =====
22 August 2024  
 
that their sponsor is a sponsor within the meaning of the Regulations in R130, it can exercise its 
equitable jurisdiction to consider humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) factors [A65]However, 
when a refusal is based on the fact that the sponsor has not met the minimum necessary income 
requirement set out in R134 or is in default of a previous sponsorship as of the date that the 
undertaking was given, officers should argue that the fact that the sponsor would meet the 
requirements if the current situation were taken into consideration does not constitute, in itself, 
sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds. 
 
Hearings officers should argue that, for an appeal to be allowed in equity, the decision must be 
based on factors other than an improvement in the sponsor’s financial situation or the fact that the 
sponsor is no longer in default. Officers should ask the IAD to note that the sponsor had the option 
of taking a refund of the processing fee or proceeding with their application, knowing it would be 
refused because they did not meet the requirements at the time. Otherwise, allowing persons who 
did not meet the regulatory requirements during the specific time frame to sponsor a member of 
the family class negates the effect of the Regulations. 
 
See the PDI on Permanent Residence, Family classes, for more information. 
 
8.11. Bad faith marriage [R4(1)] 
 
The IAD will consider a refusal by the IRCC office in order to determine whether section R4(1) is 
applicable, thereby excluding the applicant as a member of the family class. A “bad faith” or 
“non-genuine” relationship pursuant to R4(1) is present when either a relationship is not genuine, or it 
was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act. This 
creates a disjunctive relationship between the “genuineness” and the “purpose” of the bad faith 
assessment. This clarifies that a finding of bad faith can be made if either of these elements is present. 
 
Therefore, the wording of subsection 4(1) of the Regulations is unambiguous; a finding 
of bad faith can involve either a finding that the marriage was entered into primarily for 
the purpose of immigration or that the marriage is not genuine. This interpretation was 
confirmed by Chief Justice Paul Crampton in Gill v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration), 2012 FC 1522. 
 
When conducting the file review in preparation of the appeal, it is important to be cognizant of the 
legal framework within which sponsorship appeals are considered. In assessing whether a 
marriage/common law relationship/conjugal relationship was entered primarily for the purpose of 
acquiring status or privilege or whether the marriage was genuine, the IAD must take into 
consideration the totality of the evidence on the balance of probabilities standard. Since the hearing is 
a de novo hearing, the IAD’s role is to evaluate all of the evidence gathered up to the hearing so as 
to determine whether section 4(1) of the Regulations applies. 
 
Further instructions are available under the PDI (Program Delivery Instructions) – identifying a 
relationship of convenience. 
 


===== PAGE 33 =====
22 August 2024  
 
 
Other important guidance established in jurisprudence: 
 
 
The appeal to the IAD is a de novo appeal, in which the IAD must consider afresh 
whether the person sponsored as a spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner is a 
member of the family class. Singh Sandhar v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 
2013 FC 662;
The relevant time to assess the marriage’s genuineness is the present, while the relevant 
time to assess the primary purpose of the marriage is in the past, i.e., at the time of the 
marriage. Singh v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 1077; 
 
The first part of the test requires an assessment of whether the marriage “was entered into 
primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act”. In assessing 
whether the test is satisfied, the focus must be upon the intentions of both parties to the 
marriage at the time of the marriage. The Federal Court has recognized that the testimony 
of the couple parties regarding what they were thinking at that time typically will be the 
most probative evidence regarding their primary purpose for entering into the marriage. Gill
v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1522; 
 
A finding that a marriage is genuine weighs “significantly in favour of a marriage that was 
not entered into for the purpose of gaining status in Canada”. However, the finding that a 
marriage is genuine is not determinative of the primary purpose. Sandhu v. Canada 
(Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 834;
 
Evidence of commitment subsequent to the marriage can be used to prove the primary 
purpose of the marriage. This might include evidence of a continuing relationship or the 
birth of a child. However, such evidence is not necessarily determinative. Gill v. Canada 
(Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1522; Sandhu v. Canada (Citizenship and 
Immigration), 2014 FC 834;
 
The Board, must be careful about imposing western or Canadian paradigms on non- 
western culture. Nadasapillai v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 72;
 
The birth of a child is not determinative, however in assessing whether a marriage is 
genuine great weight must be afforded to the birth of a child. Gill v. Canada (Citizenship 
and Immigration), 2010 FC 122.
 
8.12. New relationship [R4.1] 
 
An applicant may be refused under Regulation 4.1 if they were previously in a prescribed 
relationship with their sponsor, but dissolved it primarily for immigration purposes. Section 4.1 is 
discussed at some length in Chapter 5 of the IRB’s guideline on Sponsorship Appeals. According 
to this document, the intent of Section 4.1 has been stated to be “to prevent persons in a 
conjugal relationship from dissolving the relationship to free them to gain admission to Canada 
only to turn around and resume their previous relationship” (Harripersaud, Janet Rameena v. 
M.C.I. (IAD TA3-11611), Sangmuah, 2005). 
 
In Wen, Chun Xiu v. M.C.I. ((IAD TA5-14563), MacLean, 2007), the IAD set out a list of non- 
exhaustive factors to consider when assessing the applicability of section 4.1 of the Regulations, 
including: 
 
 
When the relationship dissolved; 
 
The reason for the dissolution of the relationship; 


===== PAGE 34 =====
22 August 2024  
 
 
 
The temporal relationship between the ending of the relationship and the forming of a 
new relationship with the subsequent partner; 
 
Evidence that the former spouses or partners did not separate or end contact with each 
other; 
 
the intent of the spouses or partners upon re-establishing their relationship; 
 
the length of the subsequent relationship; 
 
the temporal connection between the dissolving of the subsequent relationship and the 
re-establishment of a new relationship with the previous spouse or partner, and; 
 
the intentions of the parties to the new relationship with respect to immigration. 
 
It is clear from the cases of Wen and Harripersaud, as well as the IRB’s guidelines that section 
R4.1 only applies to situations involving the reunion of two parties who previously separated 
primarily for immigration purposes. For greater clarity, “the dissolution of a conjugal relationship 
between two persons and a subsequent resumption of a conjugal relationship between these two 
persons to facilitate immigration constitutes an act of bad faith.” Further instructions is available 
under the PDIs Identifying a relationship of convenience, under the section “Conjugal 
relationships—Dissolutions of convenience”. 
 
8.13. Sponsors residing in provinces under federal-provincial 
agreements [A8(1) and A9(2)] 
 
If a sponsor resides in a province that has sole responsibility for establishing and applying 
financial criteria for sponsors under a federal-provincial agreement [A8(1)], the sponsor has no 
right of appeal to the IAD on any ground of law, fact or mixed law and fact when both of the 
following circumstances exist: 
 
 
the application is refused based on the rejection of the person's application for 
sponsorship by an official of that province on the grounds that the person failed to meet 
the financial criteria or to comply with any prior undertaking concerning the sponsorship 
of any application for permanent residence and
 
the laws of that province provide the person with a right to appeal the rejection of their 
application for sponsorship.
 
Note: The sponsor can still appeal on humanitarian and compassionate grounds [A9(2)] and 
have a Certificat de Sélection du Québec (CSQ) issued by the Ministère de l’immigration, de la 
Diversité et de l’inclusion (MIDI). If the appeal is allowed, the visa office can reopen the 
processing of the application but the sponsor residing in Quebec would still need to meet the 
MIDI’s financial requirements. A refusal by the MIDI can be appealed with the Tribunal 
administratif du Québec (TAQ) and the sponsor can provide them with the positive decision from 
the IAD. The visa office can also contact the MIDI directly and provide them with the IAD 
decision for the issuance of a CSQ. 
 
At present, Quebec is the only province with such an agreement.

8.14. Members of the family class 
 
The definition of member of the family class includes spouses, common-law and conjugal 
partners, dependent children (including adopted children), children to be adopted, parents and 
grandparents, some orphaned relatives under 18 and certain other relatives in specified 
circumstances. A12(1), R116 and R117 specify who is a member of the family class. 
 
The age for dependent children is under 22 years old according to the definition found in R2 
 
8.15. Filing evidence 
 
Information and documents must be submitted in a form suitable for presentation to the IAD, 
such as a statutory declaration or the interviewing officer's reasons or GCMS notes recording the 
information or identifying the documents received. Officers' declarations should contain facts, not 
opinions or conclusions, and should clearly indicate that the person making the declaration is an 
officer. 
 
Documents must be filed with the IAD no later than 60 days after the day on which the party 
receives the appeal record. [IAD rule 26] with a written statement saying how and when the 
documents were provided to the other party[IAD rule 25].  
 
New information may be received in the form of a report, with appropriate documentation, from 
an officer in Canada or abroad who has become aware of new information concerning an 
appellant, such as marriage, the birth of a child, hospitalization, a criminal conviction or 
reliance on social assistance. 
 
The IRCC office may forward information to the officer that it has used in assessing a sponsored 
application for permanent residence. If such evidence was obtained in confidence from the 
government or an institution of a foreign state, or an international organization of states and 
cannot be released publicly, the Minister may make an application for non-disclosure of 
information to the IAD. The grounds for the application will be that disclosure of such information 
would be injurious to national security or the safety of persons. Procedures for applications for 
non-disclosure of information are found in section 7.8 above. 
 
8.16. Consenting to an appeal—Communication with the IRCC office 
 
When a decision is made to consent to a sponsorship appeal, it is imperative that the hearings 
officer inform the IRCC office of the reasons in writing. In order to assist the IRCC officers in 
identifying ways to strengthen decisions and avoid potential trends from developing, lines of 
communication with the IRCC offices must be kept open. 


===== PAGE 36 =====
22 August 2024  
 
 
Should the hearings officer notice a trend forming with particular types of refusals or refusals 
from a particular office, copies of the refusals in question should be forwarded to the Hearings 
Programs Area at HQ (Hearings-Audiences-Programs@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca) and Litigation 
Management Branch, IRCC NHQ, e-mail to: IRCC.CMBLitigationMgmtRequest- 
DemandeGestLitigesDGRC.IRCC@cic.gc.ca with an overview of the scenario. Should a trend 
develop without being brought to the attention of the IRCC office and NHQ, the number of similar 
refusals may increase. It is imperative that hearings officers and IRCC-NHQ work in collaboration 
with processing offices and the processing networks (International Network, Centralized Network 
and Domestic Network), to ensure well-reasoned, consistent decisions that can be defended 
before the IAD. 
 
8.17. Authorization to return to Canada and refusal of permanent 
residency application 
 
In circumstances where a hearings officer is faced with the issue of an Authorization to Return to 
Canada (ARC) before the Board, Hearings Officers should argue that the IAD has no authority to 
issue an ARC. The issuance of an ARC in Canada is quite rare and has been delegated to the 
manager or director levels in the IRCC and the CBSA for inland cases. Generally, a subject who is 
in Canada and requires an ARC is reported for non-compliance. It is the Minister’s jurisdiction to 
issue an ARC and should not be added as an issue before the Board. 
 
IAD has no jurisdiction to order the issuance of an ARC, regardless of whether a decision on ARC 
was made by a visa officer. However, IRCC’s position is that when a visa officer refuses to issue 
an ARC and then refuses the PR application on that basis, the IAD has H&C jurisdiction to 
overcome the inadmissibly underlying the ARC refusal, but it cannot order a visa officer to issue 
an ARC. 
 
Recent jurisprudence has supported the position that no appeal lies to the IAD from a decision to 
refuse an ARC. [MOMI v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019, FCA 163] 
 
 
 
 
 
9. Procedure for appeals involving medical inadmissibility 
 
9.1. Overview of process for medical refusal 
 
IRCC has the policy responsibility with respect to medical inadmissibility [A38]. For further 
guidance on medical refusal procedures, please refer to the Program Delivery Instructions on 
Medical Requirements. 
 
9.2. Grounds for appeal 
 
The IAD will normally deal with the issue of additional medical information w ith the appellant at 


===== PAGE 37 =====
22 August 2024  
 
the assignment court. This includes clarifying the grounds for appeal for which the information is 
intended to be used and setting time frames for providing the information. 
 
To accelerate the processing of these appeal cases, the hearings officer should try to ascertain as 
soon as possible the grounds for appeal to be used before the IAD, namely, whether there is a 
challenge in law or whether it will be argued that there are compassionate or humanitarian 
considerations that warrant the granting of special relief, or both. 
 
9.3. When to consider a new medical examination during the appeal 
process 
 
Where only compassionate or humanitarian considerations form the basis for the appeal, a new 
medical examination should not be issued during the appeal process. In these cases, the 
hearings officer will simply need to consider requesting sufficient time between receipt of the  
medical information from the appellant and the hearing. During this time, the hearings officer 
will seek the advice of Operations Directorate, Migration Health Branch, IRCC, NHQ, about the 
medical information submitted, and to consider whether to introduce an opinion of a medical 
officer as rebuttal evidence. 
 
Where newly-submitted medical information is intended to challenge the decision in law, the 
appellant or counsel should be advised that the examining health-care professional consulted by 
the applicant must refer to the medical notification of medical inadmissibility. Any health care 
professional’s report aimed at challenging the decision in law should expressly and clearly 
address the issues raised in the medical notification, that is, diagnosis, prognosis and the issue 
of excessive demand on health and social services, and the issue of whether the health condition 
is likely to be a danger to public health and safety. Prior to agreeing to a postponement for 
obtaining this new medical information, the hearings officer will confirm that the applicant is 
willing to undergo further medical examinations if a medical officer so recommends. 
 
In considering the appropriate time frame for obtaining the medical information, the hearings 
officer must be fair to the appellant and consider facilitating resolution without litigation, but 
without compromising IRCC’s interest in the finality of litigation. 
 
Generally, IRCC will not support the consideration of more than one submission of new medical 
information from counsel once an appeal has been filed unless there is a genuine need to clarify 
the evidence previously gathered by obtaining supplementary evidence. 
 
9.4. Procedures upon receipt of new medical information during the 
appeal 
 
When hearings officers receive new medical information about an applicant, they will reconfirm 
with the appellant or counsel the purpose for which the information is being submitted, review 
the new information and decide whether it should be forwarded to the Operations Directorate, 
Migration Health Branch, IRCC, at NHQ. Hearings officers must assess whether the information is 
relevant and related to the applicant’s medical condition, as described in IRCC medical officer’s 
medical assessment, namely, in terms of the diagnosis, the prognosis and the issue of excessive 
demand on health and social services, and the issue of whether the health condition is likely to 


===== PAGE 38 =====
22 August 2024  
 
be a danger to public health or safety. In most cases, the information will be forwarded to the 
Operations Directorate, Migration Health Branch, IRCC, at NHQ. However, the new information 
should not be forwarded to the Medical Services Branch if it clearly has no link with the reason 
for refusing the applicant on medical grounds or if the medical information is so vague or of such 
a general nature that it has little or no probative value. Instead, a date for hearing at the IAD 
should be requested. (Examples are provided in Appendix B.) 
 
On receipt of the new medical information, the Migration Health Branch, NHQ will transfer a copy 
to the medical officer abroad and inform both the relevant visa office and the hearings officer. 
The hearings officer will inform the IAD and appellant or counsel in writing of the timing of this 
transfer. The Migration Health Branch at NHQ and the medical officer abroad will review this new 
medical information and jointly decide if the original medical assessment should be upheld or if a 
new medical examination should take place because it appears that there is a change in the 
person’s medical status. The medical officer abroad will then forward this decision directly to the  
hearings officer, with a copy to both the visa office in charge of the case and the Migration 
Health Branch at NHQ. The findings will read as follows: 
 
Medical officer X has reviewed the applicant’s entire medical file including the newly- 
submitted medical information that consists of [list what was reviewed about the 
applicant]. After completing this review, the medical officer upholds the original medical 
assessment. In this case, the hearings officer will proceed with the appeal before the IAD. 
 
or 
 
After completing this review, it is recommended that the applicant undergo a new medical 
examination. The hearings officer will provide any direction required as to the requested 
medical examination. 
 
9.5. New medical examination 
 
When medical officers recommend a new medical examination, the officer will contact the 
applicant within 30 days, request photographs within that time frame (where necessary) and 
issue new medical instructions. 
 
Upon receipt of a notice that a new medical examination is required, the applicant should either 
undergo the medical examination within 30 days or, alternatively, provide the officer with the 
date of an appointment for the medical examination within 30 days. 
 
The medical examination will be at the applicant’s own risk and expense. The applicant should be 
advised that failure to comply within 30 days will lead IRCC to terminate the medical 
reassessment process. (Example letter provided in Appendix B.) 
 
At the same time, the hearings officer will immediately inform the appellant or counsel in writing, 
with a copy to the IAD that the applicant will be allowed to undergo a new medical examination. 
The hearings officer will also advise the appellant or their counsel that it is their responsibility to 
ensure the applicant complies with the officer’s instructions to forward passport-size photographs 
within 30 days and, if required, to undergo a medical examination or make an appointment for 
the medical examination within 30 days of receipt of the new medical instructions. The hearings 


===== PAGE 39 =====
22 August 2024  
 
officer should notify the appellant or counsel that the applicant’s failure to comply within 30 days 
may result in IRCC terminating the medical reassessment process. (Example letter provided in 
Appendix C.) 
 
It is important for IRCC office to indicate, in GCMS, the date on which the new medical 
instructions were sent out. If the applicant does not comply with the instructions, the officer will 
notify the hearings officer, who will in turn inform the IAD and ask for a hearing date to be set, 
with a copy of the request for a hearing date to the appellant or counsel. 
 
Each IRCC office should appoint a coordinator to ensure the follow-up of these cases by means of 
a bring-forward (BF) system. The results of the new medical examination must be forwarded to 
the hearings office as soon as they have been received. 
 
Hearings offices should also use a BF system to follow up on these cases with IRCC offices, at a 
minimum every three months, with appropriate follow-up to IRCC offices where no action seems 
to have been taken. GCMS could be used for follow-up by those hearings offices that have 
access. 
 
IRCC’s target time frame for the medical reassessment process is a maximum of nine months 
from the time IRCC office is informed that a new medical examination is required. 
 
9.6. Communicating medical results 
 
When the IRCC office receives the results of the medical officer’s updated medical assessment, it 
shall immediately forward them to the hearings officer, with a copy to the IAD. The IRCC officer 
must pass on the results as soon as possible to permit the Department to meet the nine -month 
processing targets. 
 
Where the re-examination reveals that the applicant is no longer medically inadmissible, there 
will be no need to pursue the appeal, barring other non-medical grounds for inadmissibility. The 
appellant or counsel should be advised in writing that processing will continue once the appeal 
has been formally withdrawn. Upon notification from the hearings office that the IAD has 
acknowledged receipt of the withdrawal of the appeal, visa officers can continue processing the 
application for permanent residence. 
 
9.7. Medical officers’ statutory declaration 
 
The specialized knowledge of a medical officer is important to hearings officers in properly 
defending medical refusals before the IAD. Although it was the practice for medical officers to 
prepare statutory declarations when they were informed that a sponsor had appealed a refusal 
on health grounds, medical officers can no longer systematically prepare statutory declarations 
for all medical refusals. 
 
Medical officers may still be called upon in some cases to provide hearings officers with statutory 
declarations to establish the connection between the diagnosis and the conclusion that the 
person’s coming to Canada might cause an excessive demand on health or social services, or is 
likely to be a danger to public health or safety. To assist medical officers, hearings officers will 
have to indicate clearly those points in the medical documents that require explanation. A

medical record contains technical terms and specialized vocabulary that are not always easy to 
understand and interpret. To help and support hearings officers in this task, the Operations 
Directorate, Migration Health Branch at IRCC, NHQ are available to answer questions from 
hearings officers and provide clarifications that could prevent additional delays. 
 
A statutory declaration can be requested in situations where the threshold of the proof can be 
very demanding, for example, when a person suffering from intellectual disability is refused 
because their entry into Canada might cause excessive demands on social services. 
 
In cases where the person’s state of health is very serious and it is recognized by the medical 
community that a person suffering from this type of illness will require repeated access to health 
services, hospitalization or major surgery, and the medical record as well as the medical 
 
notification contain sufficient details, it is not necessary to request a statutory declaration. An 
example would be a person suffering from metastatic malignancy, renal failure or AIDS. 
 
The IAD has upheld inadmissibility based on health reasons in cases where clear evidence was 
provided without a statutory declaration from a medical officer. 
 
As of June 1, 2018, IRCC has issued a temporary public policy expanding the definition of 
excessive demand. Please refer to IRCC’s PDIs for details on how this public policy may impact 
the appeal. 
 
9.8. Effective communication 
 
Communication is the key to ensuring that the set procedures are dealt with effectively. This 
means updating GCMS notes, bringing files forward on a regular basis and communicating with 
everyone involved in given cases, including the IRCC officers, medical services and hearings 
officers. If established procedures are followed, the number of requests for updates received at 
offices and unnecessary litigation before the IAD will be reduced. More importantly, client service 
in the form of more timely decisions on complex medical appeals will result.

10. Alternative dispute resolution conference (ADR) [IAD rule 69(1)] 
 
The IAD may require the parties to participate in an ADR conference in order to encourage 
the parties to resolve an appeal without having recourse to a full hearing. 
 
10.1. Purpose of ADR 
 
ADR IRP aims to empower parties to an immigration appeal to participate in the resolution of 
their case through the use of an informal meeting. This program is premised on the notion that 
litigation is often not in the best interests of the parties and that some types of appeals could be 
prevented from proceeding to a hearing by applying ADR techniques. 
 
The principal ADR method of attempting to resolve appeals is through a resolution process. An 
IAD-employed Early Resolution Officer (ERO) acts as dispute resolution officer and attempts to 
bring the parties to resolve the appeal. ADR cases are generally resolved by the sponsor 
withdrawing their appeal or by Minister's counsel consenting to it. Alternatively, in unsuccessful 
resolution processes, the evidence and legal issues required at the hearing are often reduced as 
a result of the early resolution session and a full hearing is scheduled to dispose of the appeal. 
 
It is important to note that, as Minister's counsel, hearings officers possess the authority to make 
decisions on behalf of the Minister of C&I or the Minister of PSEP when appearing at ADR 
sessions. 
 
10.2. Responsibilities of hearings officers for dispute resolution 
 
When 
Responsibility 
Before and 
during the 
ADR session 
The role of Minister's counsel is to represent the public interest and attempt to 
ensure that justice is done. 
A crucial difference between the role of Minister's counsel in the hearings 
process versus the ADR process is that an ADR approach requires parties to 
operate in a proactive manner by searching for a resolution that will avoid a 
hearing. This does not mean that compromise is reached for the sake of 
compromise. However, Minister's counsel must balance the need for program 
integrity with efficiency. 
This means ensuring that a resolution reached through ADR is consistent with 
the principles of the IRPA, and IRCC or the CBSA policy. An approach that 
acknowledges statutory obligations and ADR values is one in which the 
Minister's counsel decides to consent to an appeal because it is recognized 
that it is not in the public interest to litigate cases that have a poor chance of 
success at a hearing. 


===== PAGE 42 =====
22 August 2024  
 
Post-ADR 
In appeal cases that are resolved at ADR, an IAD-issued Summary of 
Agreement of the Parties form is completed by the ERO. The Minister's counsel 
must ensure that this form and any additional and relevant information 
relating to the reasons for the ADR settlement of the case are forwarded to the 
appropriate IRCC office. It is acceptable to do this by e-mail in addition to 
inserting this summary of agreement in the file that will be returned to IRCC 
for further processing. 
Questions regarding the outcomes of individual appeals should be directed to 
the hearings officer who acted as the Minister's counsel on the case. General 
questions regarding the use of ADR in the appeals process may be forwarded 
to the CBSA Director of the Inland Enforcement Branch at NHQ.

11. Procedure for removal order appeals 
 
The CBSA has the policy responsibility with respect to the issuance of removal orders and the 
Minister of PSEP is the respondent in removal order appeals. 
 
11.1. Persons who may appeal against removal orders 
 
Pursuant to A63(2) and A63(3), permanent residents, foreign nationals who hold a permanent 
resident visa and protected persons, may appeal against a decision at an examination or an 
admissibility hearing, their removal order to the IAD . They may appeal not only on the basis of 
legal and factual questions, but also on the basis that there are humanitarian and compassionate 
considerations that warrant granting special relief. 
 
An appeal may be based on the grounds that the decision appealed is wrong in law, fact or 
mixed law and fact or that a principle of natural justice has not been observed or that sufficient 
humanitarian and compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light of all the 
circumstances of the case. [A67] 
 
A64 provides that no appeal may be made to the IAD by a foreign national, their sponsor or a 
permanent resident if the foreign national or permanent resident has been found to be 
inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality or 
organized criminality. Inadmissibility for serious criminality here refers to an offence punished in 
Canada by a term of imprisonment of at least six months or that is described in A36(1)(b) or 
A36(1)(c). 
 
11.2. Criminality 
 
Inadmissibility provisions have been consolidated under IRPA such that provisions apply both 
inland and at the port of entry. For details on inadmissibility provisions, see ENF 1, 
Inadmissibility, and ENF 2, Evaluating inadmissibility. 
 
Situations may arise where the appellant had convictions as a young offender, and evidence 
related to those convictions is important in establishing the Minister’s case. Under A36(3)(e), 
inadmissibility on the grounds of A36(1) or A36(2) may not be based on an offence under the 
Young Offenders Act (YOA). The YOA was replaced by the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) 
which came into effect on April 1, 2003. A conditional sentence order (CSO) is not considered a 
term of imprisonment for the purpose of 64(2). [Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency 
Preparedness), 2017 SCC 50]. The SCC in Tran decided two main issues; 1) a conditional 
sentence order imposed pursuant to the regime set out in ss. 742 to 742.7 of the Criminal Code 
of Canada (CCC) does not constitute a “term of imprisonment” under paragraph 36(1)(a) of the 
IRPA and ; 2) the phrase “maximum term of imprisonment” in paragraph 36(1)(a) of the IRPA 
refers to the maximum term of imprisonment available at the time of the commission of the 
offence and not the term of imprisonment available at the time of sentencing or the time when 
admissibility is determined.

For additional information, see ENF 14, Criminal Rehabilitation, OP 19, Criminal Rehabilitation 
and ENF 28, Ministerial Opinions on Danger to the Public and to the Security of Canada. 
 
11.3. All the circumstances of the case 
 
The definition of “humanitarian and compassionate considerations” in section 6 above provides 
details of the test to be applied by the IAD when exercising its equitable jurisdiction. It also sets 
out the general factors the IAD considers when hearing removal order appeals. Removal order 
appeals differ from sponsorship appeals in that the IAD’s equitable jurisdiction includes the 
potential risk the appellant may face in their country of destination. 
 
The Supreme Court ruled in Chieu v. M.C.I., [2002] 1 S.C.R. 84 and Al-Sagban v M.C.I., [2002] 
1 S.C.R. 133 that “all the circumstances of the case” may include foreign hardship, including the 
risk that the individual may face, provided that the likely country of destination has been 
established. Based on the Supreme Court’s reasoning, it is highly likely that appellants will 
submit documentation regarding the human rights situation in the country of destination and 
other documentation related to risk at the appeal against their removal order. The Court has 
acknowledged that the Minister is entitled to have documents verified prior to the hearing o r to 
challenge their validity. 
 
Without a passport or travel document for a particular country, it is the CBSA’s position that 
there is insufficient evidence to assume which will be the likely country of destination and foreign 
hardship should be considered only where the likely country of destination has been established. 
 
If such documentation is necessary to determine the likely country of destination, the 
circumstances in the country of destination at the time of removal cannot be certain. Where the 
appellant is serving a sentence or it can be established that the removal process is particularly 
lengthy, it will become even more difficult to anticipate country conditions at an uncertain point 
in the future. 
 
Hearings officers should evaluate the circumstances of each case and, where appropriate, argue 
that, in the absence of sufficient evidence to establish the likely country of destination or time  of 
removal, anticipated risk or hardship cannot be properly evaluated. 
 
Further, appellants will have an opportunity to apply for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) 
when they become ready for removal. Foreign hardship will be more accurately assessed at the 
right time through the PRRA process. Therefore, in some cases it will be appropriate for hearings 
officers to submit that foreign hardship should be given little weight for these reasons. 
 
11.4. Mandatory conditions to be imposed by the IAD 
 
A68(2)(a) states that where the IAD stays a removal order: 
 
“it shall impose any condition that is prescribed and may impose any condition that it 
considers necessary.” 
 
Mandatory conditions are found in R251 and are as follows: 


===== PAGE 45 =====
22 August 2024  
 
251.… 
(a) to inform the Department and the IAD in writing in advance of any change in the 
person’s address; 
 
(b) to provide a copy of their passport or travel document to the Department or, if they 
do not hold a passport or travel document, to complete an application for a passport or a 
travel document and to provide the application to the Department; 
 
(c) to apply for an extension of the validity period of any passport or travel document 
before it expires, and to provide a copy of the extended passport or document to the 
Department; 
 
(d) to not commit any criminal offences; 
 
(e) if they are charged with a criminal offence, to immediately report that fact in writing 
to the Department; and 
 
(f) if they are convicted of a criminal offence, to immediately report that fact in writing to 
the Department and the Division. 
 
Note: Effective December 12, 2003, the portions of the Department of Citizenship and 
Immigration that deal with enforcement (removals, detention, investigations, hearings, appeals, 
interventions) and war crimes were transferred to the Canada Border Services Agency. 
Therefore, the words “the Agency” should be read where the words “the Department” currently 
appear in the above-referenced section of the Regulations (R251). 
 
The mandatory conditions shall be imposed in all stays of removal imposed by the IAD, whether 
the removal order was based on criminal inadmissibility or for any other removal order appeal. 
 
11.5. Discretionary conditions in criminal inadmissibility cases 
 
The IAD has discretionary power to impose non-prescribed conditions when it stays a removal. 
Generally, these conditions are imposed in cases involving criminal inadmissibility and 
entrepreneur appellants. 
 
In criminal inadmissibility appeals, conditions of a stay that are frequently imposed by the IAD 
include the following: 
 
 
provide all information, the notice and documents required by the conditions of the  stay 
by hand, by regular or registered mail, by courier or priority post to the CBSA, at 
(address of the CBSA’s office) and to the IAD (address of the IAD and fax number) It is 
the responsibility of the appellant to ensure that the documents are received by the 
Agency within any time period required by a condition of the stay. 
 
report to the CBSA on the dates set by the IAD, or the first of the month in a sequence 
chosen by the IAD. The appellant shall report in person, in writing or by telephone. The 
reports are to contain the following details: 
o 
employment or efforts to obtain employment, if unemployed; 


===== PAGE 46 =====
22 August 2024  
 
o 
current living arrangements; 
o 
marital status, including common-law relationships; 
o 
attendance at meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous, or any other drug or alcohol 
rehabilitation program; 
o 
other relevant changes of personal circumstances (i.e. separation, 
divorce, children). 
 
make reasonable efforts to seek and maintain full-time employment and immediately 
report any change in employment to the Agency. 
 
not knowingly associate with individuals who have a criminal record or who are engaged 
in criminal activity, except contact that might result while attending meetings of 
Alcoholics Anonymous, or any other drug or alcohol rehabilitation program. 
 
not own or possess offensive weapons or imitations of offensive weapons. 
 
respect all parole conditions and any court orders. 
 
refrain from the use of alcohol. 
 
keep the peace and be of good behaviour. 
 
take immediate steps to repay any and all debts owed to creditors. Provide proof of 
repayment schedule and compliance at each time of reporting to the Agency. 
 
follow or continue to follow a psychotherapy program if the probation officer sees the 
need. (If appellant withdraws consent to this condition, they must forthwith make an 
application to the IAD to have this condition removed.) 
 
engage in or continue anger management counselling with (name of therapist or group). 
 
refrain from the illegal use or sale of drugs. 
 
maintain the payment schedule as foreseen in the agreement with the Municipal Court. 
 
Discretionary conditions depend on the nature of the appellant’s situation, which will have been 
established during the hearing before the IAD. They can be suggested by the Minister’s counsel 
and the appellant, but the IAD decides which conditions will be imposed. 
 
The burden rests on the appellant to demonstrate that the conditions have been met; however, 
the CBSA’s hearings office will monitor whether the appellant complies with the mandatory and 
discretionary conditions imposed with the stay in order to report, when required, to the IAD. See 
section 11.7 below. 
 
11.6. Monitoring compliance with the conditions of a stay of removal 
 
Where the IAD has stayed a removal order, it may, at any time, on application or on its own 
initiative, reconsider the appeal [A68(3)]. 
 
The Minister or the appellant can apply to the IAD to reconsider the appeal [IAD rule 78(1)]. The 
applicant must follow IAD rule 85 for applications generally, but evidence is not required in an 
affidavit or a statutory declaration. However, a written statement of whether the subject of the 
appeal has complied with the conditions of the stay must be provided with the application. 
 
When the IAD provides notice that it may reconsider an appeal in which it stayed a removal 
order, both parties must immediately provide the IAD with a written statement concerning 
compliance with the conditions of the stay of removal [IAD rule 78(2)]. 
 
The statement of the Minister’s counsel must indicate the information the Minister has 


===== PAGE 47 =====
22 August 2024  
 
concerning compliance with the conditions of the stay and should indicate what decision the IAD 
should make when reconsidering the appeal [IAD rule 78(2) or 79(2) and 86(1)].Where a 
removal order on the grounds of criminal inadmissibility has been stayed, verification of 
compliance with the conditions imposed by the IAD is the CBSA’s responsibility. When a date is 
scheduled by the IAD for a review, a report indicating compliance, or default, with the conditions 
shall be prepared with a recommendation to the IAD. Such a recommendation may be to: 
 
 
allow the appeal, cancel the stay and quash the removal order; or 
 
maintain the stay for an extended period of time with additional conditions, or removal of 
conditions which have been met; or 
 
dismiss the appeal. 
 
11.7. Cancellation of stays by operation of law 
 
A68(4) provides that a stay is automatically cancelled by operation of law and the appeal 
terminated where a person who was found inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality or 
criminality is granted a stay of removal and is then convicted of another offence described in the 
serious criminality provisions of A36(1). 
 
Where a stay is cancelled by operation of law, hearings officers must send the appellant a notice 
in writing regarding cancellation of their stay (see Appendix E). A copy of the notice must also be 
sent to the IRB with a statement of service [IAD rule 80 and 81]. 
 
11.8. Permanent resident visa holders 
 
As outlined in manual chapter ENF 4, section 12.2, border services officers may prepare a report 
under subsection A44(1) if they establish that a foreign national in possession of a permanent 
resident (PR) visa is inadmissible. The PR visa holder may later be issued a removal order as a 
result. 
 
Under A63(2), a foreign national who holds a permanent resident visa may appeal to the IAD 
against a decision to make a removal order against them. 
 
If the appeal on the removal order is allowed, A67(2) provides that the IAD shall set aside the 
original decision and substitute a determination that, in its opinion, should have been made, 
including the making of a removal order, or refer the matter to the appropriate decision-maker 
for reconsideration. If the foreign national arrived at the point of entry while the PR visa was 
valid and the examination was deferred pursuant to section A23, the foreign national can be 
granted PR status as per R71.1. 
 
As the permanent resident visa holder will likely be in Canada following the IAD decision, the 
hearings officer must return the case to the closest local IRCC office in Canada, and not return 
the file to a migration office overseas. 
 
Pursuant to A70(1), the responsible IRCC office is bound by the IAD’s decision. Officers should 
read the IAD’s decision and reasons in order to determine next steps in processing. These cases 
should be processed on a priority basis as the PR visa holder may be have been without status 
for some time. The IRCC office must follow the following procedures depending on the IAD’s 


===== PAGE 48 =====
22 August 2024  
 
decision: 
 
 
If the IAD sets aside the original decision and refers the matter to a decision- 
maker for reconsideration, the responsible IRCC office must re-open the application, 
 
update background verifications and ensure the foreign national is not inadmissible to 
Canada before granting permanent residence. 
 
If the IAD’s decision is to allow the individual to remain in Canada, the 
permanent resident application should only be re-opened to grant permanent resident 
status. The individual may be granted permanent resident status even if the permanent 
resident visa expired, provided they initially appeared for examination and presented 
their permanent resident visa within its period of validity. Given the passage of time, the 
responsible IRCC office may update background verification of the applicant if there are 
concerns there may be new grounds that could make the applicant inadmissible to 
Canada. 
 
In both cases, family members that were not previously examined and were added to the 
application following the IAD’s decision must provide any required forms and documents, 
and complete a medical examination to allow the IRCC officer to assess their eligibility 
and admissibility.

12. Procedure: Loss of residency status appeals 
 
IRCC has the policy responsibility with respect to loss of residency status and the Minister of 
IRCC is the respondent in these appeals (as of August 3, 2018, the official name of the Ministry 
has not changed to IRCC and as such until it does change, the style of cause is to remain 
Minister of Citizenship and Immigration). 
 
12.1. In Canada 
 
Permanent residents who are determined by the Minister’s delegate to have lost their permanent 
resident status have the right to appeal their removal order against the Minister of IRCC 
pursuant to A63(3). Persons in this category are subject to the same appeal provisions as 
permanent residents who are ordered removed on other grounds of inadmissibility. 
 
For more information, see section 11. 
 
12.2. Outside Canada 
 
Pursuant to A63(4), permanent residents may appeal to the IAD, against the Minister of IRCC, 
with respect to a decision made outside Canada on the residency obligation under A28. IAD rule 
13(1)(c), 16(c) and the IAD Appeal form  require that: 
 
 
the notice of appeal be filed with the IAD of the region in Canada where the appellant last 
resided; 
 
the written reasons for the loss of status decision be filed with the notice of appeal; 
 
if the appellant wants to return to Canada for the hearing of the appeal, they must 
indicate it on the notice of appeal; and 
 
after they receive the written reasons for the decision, appellants have 60 days to file 
with the IAD a notice of appeal and the written reasons for the decision. 
 
When the notice of appeal is received, the hearings office should: 
 
 
ensure that the GCMS and NCMS “Appeals” screens are completed promptly; and 
 
enter any motions or applications associated with the appeal in the GCMS appeals screen. 
 
12.3. Record of refusal (outside Canada) 
 
IAD rule 20(4) requires that the Minister prepare an appeal record that includes a table of 
contents and the following documents: 
 
 
any documents the Minister of IRCC has that is relevant to the decision on the 
residency obligation or any issue  in the appeal; and 
 
the officer’s written decision and written reasons. 
 
All parties must receive the appeal record and proof of compliance no later than 60 days after 


===== PAGE 50 =====
22 August 2024  
 
the Minister has received the notice of appeal. 
 
12.4. Requests to return to Canada for the hearing (Outside of Canada) 
 
A31(3)(c) provides that a permanent resident shall be issued a travel document if: 
 
 
they were physically present in Canada at least once in the last 365 days; and 
 
they have made an appeal under A63(4); or 
 
the period for making an appeal has not expired. 
 
The situation will arise where permanent residents who do not meet the residency requirement 
request a travel document during the 60-day appeal period although they have not filed an 
appeal. Persons in this situation would be allowed to enter Canada during the 60-day appeal 
period even if they have not yet filed an appeal. In cases such as this, the port of entry will 
notify the hearings office. Hearings offices should monitor the file to determine if an appeal is 
filed. When an appeal is not filed within the 60-day period, the file should be referred to the 
CBSA for investigation. 
 
 
Applications must be filed with the IAD and the Minister without delay after the notice of appeal 
is filed. If the IAD is satisfied the presence of the permanent resident at the hearing is 
necessary, it will order that the permanent resident physically appear at the hearing. Where the 
IAD has ordered that the appellant be physically present, an officer shall issue a travel document 
for that purpose [A175(2)]. 
 
12.5. Dismissed appeals—Type of removal order 
 
A69(3) requires that where the IAD dismisses an appeal under A63(4) and the permanent 
resident is in Canada, it shall make the removal order. Neither the Act nor the Regulations 
 
specify what type of removal order should be issued by the IAD. To ensure consistency with 
procedures in cases involving the in-Canada determination of residency obligation, hearings 
officers should request that the IAD issue a departure order for failure to comply with the 
residency obligation [R228(2)]. 
 
12.6. Failure to appear at an appeal 
 
If an appellant fails to appear for their appeal, hearings officers should ask the IAD to declare  the 
appeal abandoned pursuant to A168(1). If the person concerned is subject to a removal order, 
this order will then come into force and they will be removable from Canada. Where an appellant 
was determined to have lost their residency status outside Canada, and the person concerned 
has returned to Canada for their appeal, officers should ask that the IAD issue the appropriate 
removal order in absentia.


===== PAGE 51 =====
22 August 2024  
 
13. Procedure: The Minister's appeal rights 
 
If a member of the Immigration Division decides at an admissibility hearing that the person 
concerned is not a person against whom a removal order should be made or, that the person 
may be granted authorization to enter Canada, the Minister of PSEP may appeal that decision to 
the IAD on questions of law or fact, mixed law and fact, or on question of a breach of a principle 
of natural justice. [A63(5) and A67(1)]. 
 
The decision to appeal an Immigration Division decision to the IAD is made at Litigation 
Management (LMB), NHQ, or CBSA Judicial Review Unit (JRU), by persons with delegated 
authority from the Minister. When the Minister decides to appeal, Litigation Management will: 
 
 
serve a notice of appeal on the respondent and the IAD within 30 days after 
the day on which the Minister receives the Immigration Division's decision 
[IAD rule 16(d)]; 
 
send a copy of the material to the appropriate hearings office and advise the hearings 
officer supervisor where the decision was made; and 
 
The Immigration Division must provide the Minister and the IAD with a certified true copy of 
the record no later than 30 days after the IAD receives the notice of appeal [IAD rule 22(b)]. 
 
When the Minister begins an appeal, Litigation Management (LMB) NHQ or CBSA Judicial 
Review Unit (JRU), will complete the GCMS appeals screen. If the Minister or the respondent 
begins a motion or application, hearings officers are responsible for completing the “Motions” 
screen in GCMS. 
 
A69(2) – In the case of an appeal by the Minister respecting a permanent resident or a 
protected person, other than a person referred to in subsection 64(1), if the Immigration Appeal 
Division is satisfied that, taking into account the best interests of a child directly affected by the 
decision, sufficient humanitarian and compassionate considerations warrant special relief in light 
of all the circumstances of the case, it may make and may stay the applicable removal order, or 
dismiss the appeal, despite being satisfied of a matter set out in paragraph 67(1)(a) or (b). 
 
After the IAD renders its decision, the hearings office promptly updates the GCMS “Appeals” or 
“Motions” screens and the NCMS screens, as the case may be. This is particularly important 
when the IAD issues a removal order. In those cases, the officer completes the appropriate 
removal order by hand and forwards the CBSA's copy of the order to the appropriate office. 
 
If the IAD dismisses the Minister's appeal and the officer, in consultation with their supervisor, 
believes that an application for judicial review of the decision is warranted, the officer should 
immediately bring the decision to the attention of Litigation Management(LMB) NHQ or CBSA 
Judicial Review Unit (JRU). The documents may be e-mailed to: 
IRCC.CMBLitigationMgmtRequest-DemandeGesLitigesDGRC.IRCC@cic.gc.ca (See ENF 9, Judicial 
Review). 
 
In addition, in dismissed appeals, the officer should make a written request for the  written 
reasons.

14. Procedure: Roles and responsibilities 
 
Role 
Responsibilities 
IRCC and CBSA’s 
Litigation Management 
The Litigation Management Branch (LMB), situated in the Case 
Management Branch, NHQ, and the  CBSA Judicial Review Unit 
(JRU) , NHQ share responsibility for the management of all the 
IRCC and the CBSA cases involving litigation in the Federal Courts 
and for ministerial appeals before the Immigration Appeal Division 
pursuant to A63(5). Litigation Management (LMB) will determine 
who should manage the case and they will refer certain cases to 
CBSA Judicial Review Unit (JRU) that fit within the JRU mandate. 
See ENF 9, Judicial Review, for more information. 
Hearings officer 
Hearings officers present cases in accordance with policies and 
functional direction from either the IRCC Admissibility Branch, or 
the CBSA Inland Enforcement Program Management Division at 
NHQ. 
The role of a hearings officer as the Minister’s counsel is to 
ensure that the integrity of the system is upheld and that justice 
is served. In most circumstances, this requires the hearings 
officer to defend the decision of an officer not to issue a visa, or 
the decision of a Minister’s delegate or the Immigration Division 
to issue a removal order. 
Exceptions may arise where the original decision is not defensible 
due to an error in law or fact or due to a breach of natural justice. 
Officers should consent to an appeal being allowed only when the 
circumstances of the case merit the original decision being 
overturned. Due to the de novo nature of IAD hearings, hearings 
officers will often have different evidence to consider and present to 
the IAD than that considered by the original decision-maker. New 
evidence is often introduced through documentation at the hearing. 
It is essential that hearings officers be familiar with the IAD Rules

Appendix B – Examples of cases that do not need to be forwarded 
to Operations Directorate, Migration Health Branch, NHQ, by the 
officer 
The officer should not forward the new medical information about the applicant to Operations 
Directorate, Migration Health Branch at NHQ when it either has no link with the applicant’s 
reason for refusal on medical grounds or the medical information is so vague or of such a  general 
nature that it has little or no probative value. Instead, the officer should request that a date be 
set for a hearing at the IAD. The following are examples of cases where the officer should not 
forward the new medical information to the Migration Health Branch at NHQ: 
 
1. when the person concerned was initially found inadmissible because they were diagnosed 
with emphysema, and the new medical information received about the applicant states 
that they are being treated for an unrelated condition (e.g., a broken leg); 
2. when the applicant was initially found inadmissible because of hypertension and the  new 
medical information received deals with the applicant’s prognosis with diabetes; or 
3. the applicant was found inadmissible because of cancer, and the new medical information 
submitted states that the applicant’s hypertension is being treated and there is a good 
prognosis. 
 
Note: If the officer is uncertain whether the submitted information refers to the reason for 
medical inadmissibility, they should request clarification from their regional medical officer.
