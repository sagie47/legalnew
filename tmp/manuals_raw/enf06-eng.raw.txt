ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2)

2025-02-20 
1 What this chapter is about  
This chapter provides guidance to Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and Immigration, 
Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) officials performing the function of the Minister’s 
Delegate (MD) and exercising their authority to review reports prepared under A44(1) of the 
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).  
2 Program objectives  
The objectives of Canadian immigration legislation with regard to the inadmissibility provisions 
are: 
 
to protect the health and safety of Canadians and to maintain the security of 
Canadian society; 
 
to promote international justice and security by fostering respect for human rights 
and denying access to Canadian territory to persons, including refugee claimants, 
who are criminals or security risks. 
3 The Act and Regulations  
Under A44(1), an officer may prepare and transmit a report if that officer is of the opinion that a 
permanent resident or foreign national in Canada is inadmissible. Under A44(2), all A44(1) 
reports must be referred to the MD to determine the accuracy and validity of the report and to 
decide whether to:   
 
issue a removal order, where the MD has jurisdiction to do so; or  
 
refer the matter to the Immigration Division (ID) of the Immigration and Refugee Board 
(IRB) for an admissibility hearing. 
The IRPA provides authority both to members of the ID and to the MD to issue removal orders, 
depending on the type of allegation contained in the A44(1) report, and pursuant to the authority 
prescribed in the IRPA and the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) . 
In order to streamline the enforcement process in cases involving straightforward allegations, 
and to maintain the principle that the MD may make determinations in cases where there is little 
need to weigh evidence, the scheme of the Act and Regulations empowers the MD to issue 
removal orders under the circumstances prescribed in R228. Generally speaking, the more 
discretion and analysis required in assessing the allegation, the more likely the jurisdiction rests 
with a member of the ID.   
It is important to note that where the MD is authorized to make removal orders under R228, this 
authority applies at both ports of entry and at inland offices.  
The following table includes some of the most relevant provisions that may apply during the 
A44(2) process. Some of the authorities listed below pertain specifically to CBSA Border 
Services Officers (BSOs) at the port of entry or IRCC officers assessing applications; others are 
more relevant to CBSA Inland Enforcement Officers (IOEs).

4 Instruments and delegations 
 
A4 sets out which Minister is responsible for the administration of the IRPA. The Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration [also known as Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada 
(IRCC)] and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (PS) are jointly 
responsible for the administration and enforcement of the IRPA, however there are some 
differences. The IRCC Minister is responsible for the overall administration of the IRPA, unless 
otherwise specified. The Minister of PS has the primary responsibility for the administration of 
the IRPA as it relates to the following:  
 
 
port of entry examinations; 


===== PAGE 10 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) 
10 
2025-02-20 
 
policy lead relating to enforcement of the IRPA including arrest, detention and removal; 
 
establishment of policies respecting the enforcement of the IRPA and inadmissibility 
under A34/35/37; and 
 
declarations referred to under A42.1 (Ministerial Relief provision) 
 
Pursuant to A6(1), the responsible Minister has the authority to designate specific persons or 
classes of persons to carry out any purpose of any provision of the IRPA with respect to their 
individual mandates as described in A4, and to specify the powers and duties of the officers so 
designated. This is referred to as the designation of authority. In addition, A6(2) authorizes 
that anything that may be done by the Minister under the Act may be done by a person that the 
Minister authorizes in writing. This is referred to as delegation of authority.   
 
Each Minister who has responsibilities under the IRPA has written an instrument of delegation 
and designation that is periodically updated. The Delegation of Authority and Designations of 
Officers (D & D) instruments stipulate who has the authority to perform specific immigration-
related functions. CBSA and IRCC personnel are designated by position to perform all 
delegated or designated authorities, including those associated with A44(1)/A44(2) functions.  It 
is to be noted that the IRPA D & D instruments have a hierarchical link which means only the 
lowest level of authority is included in the D & D instruments as every position above this one 
(with a direct hierarchical link) has the same authority to perform specific immigration-related 
functions. 
 
CBSA and IRCC officials acting in the capacity of the MD in A44(2) proceedings should always 
review both the CBSA and the IRCC D & D instruments as they have authorities delegated and 
designated under both instruments, which can be found on the IL 3-  Designation of Officers and 
Delegation of Authority.  
 
The authority to review A44(1) reports has been delegated to certain CBSA and IRCC officials. 
It is important to note that while IRCC officers have been delegated the authority to review 
reports for most inadmissibility sections, A44(1) reports for inadmissibility under A34 (security 
grounds), A35 (grounds of violating human or international rights), A35.1 (sanctions) and A37 
(grounds of organized criminality) may only be prepared and reviewed by CBSA.  
 
All reports written by CBSA or IRCC officers will be reviewed by the MD who has been 
delegated the authority under the D & D instruments. If the MD is of the opinion that the report is 
well-founded, the MD will make the appropriate decision based on the evidence and determine 
whether to:  
 
 
issue a removal order, if the allegation is within the MD’s authority pursuant to R228; or  
 
refer the report to the ID pursuant to the R229. 
For additional information, see Appendix A — ‘Table: Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
(IRPA) Inadmissible Classes’  
 
Note:  Policy requires that even where officers and officials acting in the capacity of the 
Minister’s Delegate (including chiefs and directors) have the delegated authority under 
the D & D instruments, they should not perform Minister's Delegate functions and 
reviews until they have successfully completed the necessary training to perform the 
A44(2) function.  This policy is consistent with the Federal Court’s decision in Zhang v. Canada

(Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 362 where judicial review was granted based on a 
finding that there was an inadequate record before the court to conclude that the MD had 
received the required Minister’s Delegate Review training and was therefore authorized to issue 
a removal order.  
  
5 Definitions 
Adult legally responsible 
An adult legally responsible for a minor or suspected incompetent person may be their parent or 
legal guardian. If the accompanying adult is not a parent or guardian, reasonable efforts must 
be made to contact a parent or guardian. For more information on accompanying adults, please 
refer to ENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited Children. 
 
Foreign national 
A person who is not a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident; includes a stateless person 
[A2(1)]. 
 
Indian 
A person who is registered as an Indian under the Indian Act [R2]. 
 
Minor  
A minor is a person under 18 years of age. Persons claiming to be less than 18 years of age are 
to be treated as minors unless there is conclusive evidence that they are 18 years old or older.  
 
Permanent resident 
A person who has acquired permanent residence status and has not subsequently lost that 
status under A46 [A2(1)]. 
 
Persons unable to appreciate the nature of proceedings  
This phrase refers to persons who are unable to understand the reason for the proceedings or 
why they are important, or cannot give meaningful instructions to counsel about their case. An 
opinion regarding competency may be based on the person's own admission, the person's 
observable behaviour at the proceeding, or an expert opinion on the person's mental health or 
intellectual or physical faculties. Pursuant to R228(4)(b) and R229(4)(b), the authority to issue 
any removal order for persons unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings shall be the 
Immigration Division.  
 
Protected person 
A person on whom refugee protection is conferred in Canada and whose claim or application 
has not subsequently been deemed to be rejected because of cessation or vacation

6 Departmental policy 
6.1 Procedural fairness  
Actions and decisions made under the IRPA must be made in accordance with the principles of 
procedural fairness and natural justice. These principles apply to the exercise of the powers of 
the Minister’s delegate. In general terms, this means the MD must: 
 
Allow the person concerned the opportunity to know the case to be met and present 
all relevant facts of the case; 
 
Inform the person concerned about the purpose and possible outcomes of the MD 
proceedings; 
 
Provide the person concerned with a reasonable opportunity to respond; 
 
Allow the person to respond to facts or new information that will be considered by the 
decision-maker; 
 
Fully and fairly consider the evidence; 
 
Render decisions that are impartial and free from bias; 
 
Provide the notice of decision and reasons for the decision to the person concerned; 
 
Inform the person concerned of a right to counsel if an A44(2) MD proceeding is 
caused where the person is detained and the Minister has the authority to issue a 
removal order;  
 
Ensure that an interpreter is provided where necessary  
It is important to differentiate those cases where the MD may issue a removal order and those 
cases where the jurisdiction to issue a removal order lies with the ID, as different procedural 
requirements and considerations will apply in order to ensure that procedural fairness and 
natural justice are met.  
The content of procedural fairness will also depend on the status of the person concerned and 
additional considerations will apply for permanent residents and protected persons.  
For additional information, see ENF 5 Writing 44(1) reports:  section 6.1,  ‘Procedural fairness’; 
section 8, ‘Considerations before reviewing an A44(1) report- Scope of officer discretion’;  
section 9.2, ‘Special considerations for protected persons’; section 10, ‘A44(1) reports 
concerning permanent residents of Canada’. 
In reaching a decision, the MD must take into account representations made by persons or by 
their counsel, and make particular note of the nature and content of these representations. All 
decisions of the MD are subject to judicial review, with leave, by the Federal Court of Canada. 
Certain decisions that the MD makes may be subject to appeal before the Immigration Appeal 
Division (IAD), where a statutory right of appeal exists under the IRPA. 
Individuals subject to A44 proceedings have the right to know the case against them, which 
generally includes understanding what information the MD would rely on in making a decision. 
Each case, however, must turn on its facts and the level of disclosure required at the A44 stage 
may vary depending on the circumstances of the case.  
If an MD relies on new information [i.e., information that was not already provided at the A44(1) 
stage] that is material and that the person concerned would not otherwise be aware of or have

access to, the MD should ensure that it is provided to the person concerned [for further details, 
see Durkin v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 174]. This is 
particularly important where the MD has jurisdiction to issue the removal order, as a higher level 
of procedural fairness will apply. Conversely, in cases where the ID has the jurisdiction to issue 
the removal order, there is no duty to disclose other than information which is “material and 
otherwise unknown or unavailable” at A44(1) or A44(2) since the person will be entitled to 
receive disclosure in the context of an admissibility hearing [Jeffrey v. Canada (Public Safety 
and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 1180]. With respect to all requests for disclosure, MDs 
should always be cognizant of the legal rules and restrictions on the general disclosure of 
documents (e.g., Privacy Act, information sharing agreements, etc.). For further details, MDs 
should refer to ENF 5 Writing 44(1) reports, section 12.5, ‘Disclosure of documents’. 
6.2 Procedures for persons less than 18 years old or persons unable to 
appreciate the nature of the proceedings 
R228(4) provides for specific safeguards for certain vulnerable persons by requiring that where 
the person: 
 
is under 18 years of age and not accompanied by a parent or an adult legally 
responsible for them;  or  
 
is unable, in the opinion of the Minister, to appreciate the nature of the proceedings and 
is not accompanied by a parent or an adult legally responsible for them; 
the matter must be referred to the ID for an admissibility hearing. In these cases, the MD does 
not have jurisdiction to issue a removal order.   
Such cases will call for a higher degree of procedural fairness at the A44 stage and officers and 
MDs must take extra care to ensure that the person’s interests are represented and that the 
evidence has been fully and fairly considered. 
During the ID proceedings, a designated representative will be appointed pursuant to A167(2) to 
represent the person’s interests and ensure that procedural fairness requirements are met with 
respect to presenting evidence relevant to the case and providing a response to facts or new 
information that will be considered by the decision-maker. In these hearings, parties will also be 
governed by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Chairperson Guideline 8: 
‘Procedures With Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB’ 
Where a person appears to be unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings, it is 
important for the MD to identify this as soon as possible during the A44(2) proceedings. Where 
the MD, in the course of their interactions with a person, has identified that a person has a 
suspected or known mental illness and does not appreciate the nature of the proceedings, this 
should be clearly documented in the MD’s decision so that in cases where the case is being 
referred for an admissibility hearing, the need for a designated representative is flagged for the 
ID. 
In such cases, the MD should also ensure that other departmental and agency guidelines with 
respect to dealing with vulnerable persons are followed. See section 6.6, ‘Dealing with 
vulnerable persons’; ENF 20 Detention; and ENF 34 Alternatives to Detention. 
For additional guidance on how to identify a vulnerable person, see IRCC Program delivery 
instructions on Processing in-Canada claims for refugee protection of minors and vulnerable 
persons.

6.3 Official languages 
Both the Official Languages Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms establish 
the right of individuals who are subject to administrative proceedings in Canada to communicate 
with employees of IRCC and CBSA in the official language of their choice, either French or 
English. Officials carrying out the administration of the IRPA must respect the right of the 
individual to proceed in French or English. In order to ensure that procedural fairness is 
maintained, MDs should ensure that all the Minister’s documents are provided in the language 
of the proceedings and, where necessary, obtain translations (e.g., a certificate of conviction 
from another country that is not in French or English that the Minister is relying on as evidence). 
6.4 Interpreters 
The MD must be satisfied that the person concerned is able to understand and communicate in 
either of the official languages in which the proceeding is being held. If necessary, an interpreter 
is to be provided to enable the persons to understand and communicate fully.  
Note:  Travellers arriving at a port of entry into Canada do not have an automatic right to an 
interpreter upon request during routine port of entry examinations, however there are situations 
where officers at the port of entry are required to suspend the proceedings until a qualified 
interpreter is available. This may include circumstances where the officer is considering denying 
entry to the traveller. For further information, see Nere v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 
2018 FC 672. 
CBSA officers should consult guidelines on the use of interpreters contained in ENF 4 Port of 
entry examinations (section 8.5 ‘Use of interpreters’).  
For further information see IRCC Program delivery instructions (PDI) on interpreters. 
6.5 Counsel  
Persons do not have a right to counsel at MD review proceedings, unless they are detained. In 
all detained cases, persons must be given the opportunity to obtain and instruct counsel at their 
own expense. Counsel includes a barrister, solicitor, family member, consultant or friend. 
In detained cases: The MD must inform persons of their right to counsel prior to commencing 
the MD review. This right applies in all cases (port of entry and inland) where a person is 
detained under an Act of Parliament and includes situations where the person is detained by the 
criminal courts while facing charges or serving a sentence and subject to IRPA proceedings. 
Port of entry:  Generally, CBSA’s policy is not to permit counsel at MD review proceedings 
unless arrest/detention has occurred. However if the MD is dealing with an individual who does 
have counsel present, the officer should allow the counsel to remain present as long as counsel 
does not interfere with the examination process. 
Note:  In Dehghani v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 
1053], the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) determined that the principles of fundamental 
justice do not include the right to counsel for routine information-gathering, such as that 
gathered at port of entry examination interviews. The SCC further held that an Immigration 
Secondary examination at a port of entry does not constitute a detention within the meaning of 
paragraph 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.1  
                                                          
1 Although the SCC held that secondary examination does not constitute detention, this decision also 
highlighted that detention within the meaning of section 10(b) of the Charter would result where restraints 
on the person’s liberty by state authorities have gone beyond those required for the routine processing or 


===== PAGE 15 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2)

2025-02-20 
For further information regarding right to counsel at POE examinations, officers should refer to  
ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. 
In non-detained inland cases (CBSA/IRCC): A non-detained person does not have the right to 
have counsel present during the MD review, however in the spirit of procedural fairness, the MD 
shall inform the person of the possibility of obtaining counsel for the MD review prior to 
commencing the proceeding. Call-in notices for MD reviews should advise the person that they 
may have counsel present for the MD review. MDs are not obligated to postpone MD review 
proceedings in non-detained cases due to counsel unavailability, however, may consider such 
requests on case-by-case basis. 
Where counsel is representing the person concerned at the proceeding, the MD should ensure 
that counsel’s identity, the fact of counsel’s presence at the proceeding and statements made 
by counsel on behalf of the person concerned are documented in the their notes, and that 
counsel’s representations have been considered in their decision. The MD may also need the 
person’s representative to complete a Use of a Representative form (IMM 5476). For further 
information, see IRCC Program delivery instructions on Use of Representatives. 
Participation by counsel involves speaking on the client's behalf, presenting evidence and 
making submissions on the issues. Allowing counsel to participate does not mean that the MD is 
required to tolerate disruptive or discourteous behaviour by counsel. Where such conduct is 
encountered, the MD may require counsel to leave and/or the proceeding may be adjourned to 
another time. In such cases, the MD should ensure to document their reasons for taking such 
action. 
6.6 Dealing with vulnerable persons in the context of A44 
6.6.1 Considerations for vulnerable persons in the context of A44 
 
It is an overall goal of Canada’s immigration program to treat all persons with dignity and 
respect. In exercising their IRPA authorities, officials must approach all cases in a 
nonjudgmental manner, remain sensitive to the potential needs and limitations of vulnerable 
persons, and recognize that a person they are dealing with may have experienced some form of 
violence, abuse or trauma. 
 
In the context of A44, vulnerable persons may face particular challenges, including an impaired 
ability to answer questions/provide information to officials respecting a potential IRPA 
inadmissibility, due to a physical or psychological frailty or for other reasons. Such persons may 
include, but would not be limited to: 
 
 
minors (under 18 years of age), including unaccompanied minors; 
 
elderly persons; 
 
individuals with severe medical conditions or physical disabilities;  
 
persons with a suspected or known mental illness; 
 
persons who have suffered traumatic experiences that resulted in some degree of 
vulnerability, including: 
                                                          
screening of their application to enter Canada. Further, while the SCC’s decision affirmed that delays in 
routine examinations due to operational necessity do not mean the person is “detained”, officers should 
be cognizant that unreasonably lengthy delays in the examination could lead to the conclusion that the 
person is detained within the meaning of section 10(b) of the Charter.

o victims2 of gender-based violence (GBV) (see section 6.6.3); 
o victims/suspected victims of trafficking in persons (VTIPs) or family violence. 
 
In the context of A44 procedures, officers/MDs should: 
 
 
Identify vulnerable persons at the earliest opportunity in order to ensure that appropriate  
accommodations are made and any relevant considerations are factored into decisions 
and actions taken. In some instances, officers/MDs will need to use their observational 
skills, discretion and sound judgement in identifying a person as vulnerable.   
 
 
Recognize that a vulnerable individual’s ability to respond to questions or provide 
information may be severely impaired, and remain sensitive to the impact of a perceived 
vulnerability during the A44 process, including during interviews. 
 
 
To the extent possible, prevent vulnerable persons from becoming traumatized or re-
traumatized during the A44 process. 
 
Where an individual who is subject to IRPA enforcement action is identified as a victim of 
violence, trauma or abuse, including victims of GBV, family violence or trafficking in persons, or 
other forms of abuse such as sexual abuse or labour abuse, officers/MDs must take a victim-
centered and trauma-informed approach in order to avoid re-victimizing people who report 
violence or abuse.  
 
A victim-centred approach focuses on the needs and concerns of victims to ensure a 
compassionate and sensitive delivery of services in a nonjudgmental manner.  
 
A trauma-informed approach is one that avoids triggering trauma that may have placed the 
individual in their current situation. 
 
The guidelines in sections 6.6.2 to 6.6.5 are aimed at assisting MDs in identifying vulnerable 
persons and applying a victim-centred and trauma-informed approach when dealing with 
vulnerable persons at A44. 
 
In addition to the guidelines set out in this manual chapter, MDs should always ensure that other 
Departmental and Agency guidelines with respect to dealing with vulnerable persons and 
minors are followed, including IRCC’s Program delivery instructions on Identifying sensitive 
cases and on Processing in-Canada claims for refugee protection of minors and vulnerable 
persons, where applicable. 
6.6.2 Sexual orientation and gender identity and expression and sex characteristics3 
 
Some IRPA enforcement cases may involve individuals with, or who are perceived to have, 
                                                          
2 It is important to recognize wherever the term “victim” is used, that some persons who have experienced 
violence, trauma or abuse may prefer to be referred to as “survivors” rather than “victims”. 
 
3 Please note that terminology in this section may have further evolved following the publication date of 
this manual. Consult most recent GoC publications for most up to date terminology.

sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions (SOGIE)4 that may not conform  to 
socially accepted norms in a particular cultural environment. Such individuals include, but are 
not limited to: Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and additional 
sexually and gender diverse (2SLGBTQI+) individuals. Depending on factors such as race, 
ethnicity, religion, faith or belief system, age, disability, health status, social class and education, 
individuals with diverse sexual orientations and identities may recognize and express their 
identity differently.  
 
Individuals may conceal their SOGIE out of mistrust or fear of repercussion by state and non-
state actors, or due to previous experiences of discrimination, stigmatization, bullying, 
ostracism, violence or sexual assault. These circumstances may manifest themselves as an 
individual being reluctant to discuss, or having difficulty discussing, their SOGIE with an officer 
based on a fear or general mistrust of authority figures, particularly where intolerance or 
punishment of individuals with diverse SOGIE are sanctioned by state officials in an individual’s 
country of origin. 
 
Officials need to be sensitive to the possibility that SOGIE issues may exist in any case they 
encounter when executing their IRPA authorities. Officials must follow all relevant guidelines 
and procedures pertaining to handling SOGIE cases during the A44 process, remain sensitive 
to gender-related considerations when interacting with the person and be careful to use gender-
neutral or inclusive terms or terms that reflect the person’s gender identification in 
documentation/notes and when completing Departmental and Agency forms. 
 
Officials should consult the Internationally recognized sexual orientation or gender identity or 
expression (SOGIE) definitions on IRCC’s Connexion for further information. 
6.6.3 Victims of gender-based violence (GBV) 
 
When considering enforcement under A44, officers and MDs need to be sensitive to the fact 
that a person they encounter may have been subjected to specific violence, trauma or abuse 
based solely on their gender, perceived gender, gender identity or gender expression, as 
well as sexual orientation. This is referred to as gender-based violence (GBV), which is a 
human rights violation.  
 
It is important to note that GBV is not limited to physical violence and can also include 
emotional/psychological abuse, harassment, threats, sexual violence, coercive control, 
humiliation, financial abuse, discrimination or neglect. It is important to note that these may also 
occur online through “cyberviolence”5.  
 
Officers and MDs should be aware that certain individuals face a greater risk of experiencing 
GBV, including:  women, girls, 2SLGBTQI+ people and people living with disabilities. Moreover, 
the risk of GBV may be increased with the intersection of any two or more of these 
                                                          
4 Also includes individuals with, or who are perceived to have diverse sex characteristics and may also be 
referred to as SOGIESC. For example, see the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada’s 
Chairperson’s Guidelines on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity 
and Expression, and Sex Characteristics: https://irb.gc.ca/en/legal-policy/policies/Pages/GuideDir09.aspx.

tracking their location, to scare, intimidate or humiliate a person” (Government of Canada, Fact sheet:

characteristics. Other groups that may experience high levels of GBV may also include Black 
women and newcomer women to Canada6.  
 
Intimate partner violence (IPV), also referred to as domestic violence or spousal violence, is a 
widespread form of GBV that encompasses multiple forms of harm perpetrated by a current or 
former intimate partner or spouse. IPV can occur in many types of relationships, including 
between married or common-law spouses as well as within dating relationships, regardless of 
gender and sexual orientation and whether or not the partners co-habit. 
 
For further information respecting IPV, see the Government of Canada’s Fact sheet on Intimate 
partner violence. 
 
Depending on their cultural background, victims of GBV may be reluctant to disclose their 
experiences in order to not “shame” their families or communities. Similarly, women who have 
been subjected to IPV/domestic violence or abuse may also be reluctant to provide information, 
especially against the alleged perpetrator. MDs should be alert to such cases and will ensure to 
the extent possible that specific accommodations are made during interviews as set out  (e.g., 
have a female officer either conduct or be present during an interview, and arrange, if possible, 
for a female interpreter). See section 6.6.4 below for additional guidance on conducting 
interviews. 
 
Victims and survivors of GBV may be encountered both at the port of entry or inland. In such 
cases, officers/MDs should: 
 
 
Consider the factors that led to the individual’s breach of IRPA requirements or conditions, 
including the possibility that the person was placed in their situation as part of abuse or 
through coercion or threats; 
 
Be aware that perpetrators of GBV are known to use threats of denunciation to immigration 
authorities as a tool to control and oppress victims through fear of deportation and/or 
detention. For example, MDs shall consider any such factors that may lead them to believe 
that a foreign national overstayed their status as a result of being placed in that situation by 
an abuser; 
 
Within the confines of an MD’s limited discretion at A44(2), be sensitive to personal 
circumstances as well as the consequences of immigration enforcement;  
 
Where appropriate and within an MD’s scope of discretion, consider other options where 
there are IRPA inadmissibility concerns. At the port of entry, this may include allowing the 
person to withdraw their application to enter Canada (i.e. Allowed to leave) or issuing a 
Temporary resident permit (TRP) to overcome an inadmissibility that may have resulted 
from GBV. In the inland and port of entry context, this may include a referral to IRCC for 
TRP consideration and/or to community-based service organizations experienced in 
providing services to GBV victims and survivors in accordance with existing policy and 
regional procedures or allowing the person to make arrangements to leave Canada if they 
plan to do so. 
 
For further resources on GBV, please refer to the Government of Canada’s Gender-Based 
Violence Knowledge Centre (Canada.ca).

6.6.4 Interviewing vulnerable persons  
 
Officers and MDs must be alert to situations where a person’s ability to answer questions and 
present information during A44 proceedings may be impacted by one or more factors listed in 
section 6.6.1 above. Officers/MDs may find that vulnerable persons may have issues affecting 
their memory, behaviour, or ability to recount relevant events including symptoms that have an 
impact on the consistency and coherence of their statements.  
 
Officers/MDs should be cognizant that individuals react to violence, trauma and abuse in 
different ways and not all victims will exhibit identical or even similar signs and/or symptoms. 
While some individuals may show signs of distress, including anxiety, irritability, nervousness, 
agitation, anger and aggressiveness, others may be easily intimidated and have difficulty 
communicating. 
 
In order to conduct A44 interviews in a way that avoids traumatizing vulnerable persons or re-
victimizing persons who have experienced violence, trauma or abuse, officers/MDs should: 
 
Recognize that some vulnerable persons may display less obvious symptoms of a 
vulnerability, which may not become apparent until the person is interviewed/examined. 
Officers/MDs may need to rely on observational skills and sound judgement in identifying 
signs and symptoms of a vulnerability.   
 
Be aware that some vulnerable persons may require special accommodations during the 
interview. Remain sensitive to the fact that victims of severe trauma may have difficulties 
coping with the interview process because they are confined to a closed room with the 
interviewer. 
 
Create optimum conditions to minimize stress. Allow for frequent breaks, if necessary 
and to the extent possible.  
 
Be conscious of cultural and gender considerations which may affect communication 
such as the person and officer being the same gender, where possible. 
 
Recognize that victims of violence or abuse may fear people in authority and may be 
intimidated by the many questions that are being asked by officials. 
 
Recognize that victims of GBV or other forms of violence or abuse may become 
distressed at the prospect of being interviewed by an official of the opposite sex. 
 
Where appropriate, speak to the person alone first in a confidential setting and ask if 
they are comfortable speaking in front of family members (particularly parents, children 
or relatives of a particular gender). 
 
Provide the person with a fair opportunity to tell the story. 
 
Be cognizant that there may only be one opportunity for an individual to reach out to 
authorities, and for authorities to refer a victim of violence or abuse to victim support 
services.  
 
Be courteous, respectful, sensitive and aware of own biases. 
 
Be aware that some questions may cause a victim to recall painful events. 
 
Treat the person with sensitivity and with empathy and with full respect of their human 
rights. 
 
Avoid an authoritarian approach. 
 
Avoid over-familiarity through eye contact or body language. 
 
Ask simple questions and use encouragement. 
 
Use active listening. 
 
Allow free speech and avoid interruption. 
 
Remember that if the vulnerable person is under 18 years of age or unable to appreciate 
the nature of the proceedings, procedural safeguards set out in section 6.2 will apply.

6.6.5 TRPs for victims or suspected victims of trafficking in persons (VTIP) or family 
violence  
 
Officials should keep in mind that there are specific policy guidelines in place respecting 
suspected or known victims of trafficking in persons (VTIP) and victims of family violence. While 
only IRCC officials may issue TRPs to VTIPs or victims of family violence, CBSA officials should 
follow the guidelines set out in the IRCC Program delivery instructions for handling these cases. 
For example, cases in which a foreign national is identified by the CBSA as a VTIP or victim of 
family violence should be referred to the responsible IRCC local office on an urgent basis. There 
are also instructions pertaining to IRCC procedures for contacting CBSA with respect to 
individuals who are subject to a removal order that are applying for a VTIP or victim of family 
violence TRP.  
 
When dealing with victims or suspected victims, officials must continue to apply existing policy 
guidance respecting VTIPs and victims of family violence. For example, MDs will take a victim-
centred and trauma-informed approach when a permanent resident or foreign national is 
identified as a possible VTIP and follow existing guidelines and procedures specific to 
identifying and interviewing suspected VTIPs, as well as identifying and conducting interviews 
for suspected human traffickers who are encountered at the port of entry or inland.  
 
Officers and MDs should always be alert to any information that raises concerns that a minor 
child has been trafficked, smuggled or abducted. In such situations, officers/MDs should refer to 
the procedures set out in the following guidance: 
 
ENF 21 Recovering missing, abducted and exploited children  
 
Temporary resident permits (TRPs): Considerations specific to victims of trafficking in 
persons 
 
 
 
7 Procedure: Review of the A44(1) report by the Minister’s Delegate 
7.1 Transmission of an A44(1) report to the Minister’s Delegate 
Under A44(1), an officer may prepare a report if that officer is of the opinion that a permanent 
resident or foreign national in Canada is inadmissible.   
All A44(1) reports concerning permanent residents and foreign nationals must be referred to the 
MD making the final decision about whether or not to issue a removal order or refer the matter 
to the Immigration Division. 
Where the officer transmitting the report to the MD has also prepared an A44(1) case highlights 
form (IMM 5084B for inland cases or BSF516 for port of entry cases), a detailed memorandum 
or an A44(1) narrative report, this must also accompany the A44(1) report.   
The officer transmitting the report must also forward to the MD, all documentation and evidence 
relied on by the officer in forming their opinion, including but not limited to: 
 
for permanent residents, proof of a search of citizenship records; 
 
copies of all relevant immigration documents and other certificates and affidavits that 
can be obtained from IRCC, if applicable; 


===== PAGE 21 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) 
21 
2025-02-20 
 
originals or copies of other documents relevant to the case, such as a birth certificate, 
marriage certificate, a certificate of conviction or other evidence of a previous conviction 
that is acceptable in a court of law; 
 
police occurrence reports; 
 
probation, parole and psychiatric assessments; 
 
police records and information on other convictions not reportable under A44(1); 
 
other documentary evidence that supports the allegation(s), including statutory 
declarations;  
 
evidence filed by the person concerned. 
 
See also, ENF 1 Inadmissibility; ENF 2 Evaluating inadmissibility; and ENF 23 Loss of 
permanent resident status. 
The importance of forwarding the officer’s recommendation to the MD at the same time as the 
A44(1) report is transmitted was highlighted in Wong v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 
2011 FC 971.  In that case, the Federal Court dealt with the legality of two removal orders 
issued by the MD prior to the A44(1) case highlights form being signed and dated. In finding that 
this sequence of events rendered the orders improperly issued and therefore null and void, the 
Court affirmed that the officer’s recommendation needed to be reviewed by the MD as part of 
the A44 process before a removal order was issued.   
7.2 Reviewing the A44(1) report 
Once the A44(1) report is transmitted by the officer to the MD, the MD will then review the report 
to determine its accuracy and validity. 
Accuracy refers to the determination of the correctness of details contained in the report. 
Prior to any substantive review by the MD, it is important for the MD to conduct an initial review 
of the A44(1) report to ensure that: 
 
the biographical data is correctly cited [name(s), date of birth]; 
 
the status of person concerned is correctly identified in the A44(1) report; 
 
the inadmissibility section has been properly cited; and  
 
the A44(1) report has been signed and dated.   
Any report containing such errors should be sent back to the officer who wrote the A44(1) report 
so that it can be corrected accordingly. 
Validity refers to the determination of whether the report is well-founded, based on the MD’s 
review of all of the evidence. 
If the report is found to be valid, then the MD upholds the report and decides on the disposition 
of the case. 
The disposition of the MD review under A44(2) will depend on the allegations and 
circumstances of each case and may include: 
 
referring the case to an admissibility hearing; 
 
issuing a removal order; 


===== PAGE 22 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) 
22 
2025-02-20 
 
allowing the person to leave Canada (POE cases only); 
 
issuing a Temporary resident permit (TRP); or 
 
issuing a warning letter (permanent residents/protected persons). 
If the MD finds that the report is not valid, the MD may authorize the person to enter or remain in 
Canada;  in certain circumstances, the MD may also decide to send the report back to an officer 
to for consideration of preparing a new report with the accurate allegation. 
7.3 Procedure: Evidentiary requirements 
To form the opinion that an A44(1) report is well-founded, the MD must have knowledge of the 
evidentiary rules and requirements for immigration matters. Knowledge of what may be required 
to substantiate an allegation of inadmissibility is an important consideration in all cases. 
Each allegation has specific requirements for evidence and officers are to be guided by the 
content of ENF 1 Inadmissibility; ENF 2 Evaluating Inadmissibility; and ENF 18 Human or 
international rights violations. 
In order to make a decision on the validity of an A44(1) report, the MD must be satisfied that the 
applicable burden and standard of proof may be met and that sufficient evidence has been or 
may be gathered to ensure that each element of an inadmissibility allegation may be satisfied. 
7.4 Burden of proof  
The burden of proof, in the context of immigration legislation, refers to who is responsible for 
establishing admissibility under the IRPA. 
Under A45(d), the burden of establishing admissibility depends on whether or not the person 
has been authorized to enter Canada.  
In cases of foreign nationals who are seeking entry (primarily applicable to port of entry cases) 
or those who entered Canada illegally, the onus is on the individual to establish that they are not 
inadmissible. Where the person has been authorized to enter Canada the burden to establish 
inadmissibility is on the Minister. 
Table 3:  Burden of proof 
Persons authorized/not 
authorized to enter

Burden of proof 
Permanent residents and

A45(d) requires the Immigration Division to 
make a removal order against a 
permanent resident or a foreign national 
who has been authorized to enter Canada, 
if it is satisfied that they are inadmissible. 
Consequently, in cases involving persons 
who were granted entry into Canada, 
including permanent residents, the onus 
rests on the Minister to establish that the 
person is inadmissible.

Foreign nationals not 
authorized to enter 
A45(d) requires the Immigration Division to 
make a removal order if it is not satisfied 
that a foreign national who has not been 
authorized to enter Canada is not 
inadmissible. A21(1) states that a foreign 
national becomes a permanent resident 
and A22(1) states that a foreign national 
becomes a temporary resident if an officer 
is satisfied that, inter alia, the foreign 
national is not inadmissible. 
This applies to persons seeking entry into 
Canada or those persons who have 
entered illegally. Consequently, the onus is 
on these persons to establish that they are 
not inadmissible.

7.5 Standard of Proof 
The term “standard of proof” refers to the degree to which the decision-maker must be satisfied. 
Immigration proceedings are civil in nature and therefore the general standard of proof is the 
one applicable to civil matters: balance of probabilities. However A33 provides that, unless 
otherwise provided, the standard of proof for allegations listed under sections A34 to A37, is a 
lower standard of proof: reasonable grounds to believe that the facts have occurred, are 
occurring or may occur, applies. 
 
“Balance of Probabilities” is a civil standard of proof used in administrative tribunals. It means 
that the evidence presented must show that the facts as alleged are more probable than not. 
The party having the burden of proof must demonstrate that the evidence presented outweighs 
any opposing evidence or arguments. It is a higher standard of proof than “reasonable grounds 
to believe”, but is lower than the criminal standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt” used in 
criminal proceedings. 
 
“Reasonable grounds to believe” is a bona fide belief in a serious possibility that fact has 
been established based on credible evidence. Reasonable grounds to believe is more than 
suspicion. Some objective basis for the belief has to exist. Put another way, the fact itself need 
not be proven; it is enough to show reasonable grounds for believing the allegation true. 
Information used to establish reasonable grounds should be specific, compelling, credible and 
be received from a reliable source. 
 
The following table summarizes the standard of proof for sections A34 to A42:

7.6 Duty to provide information  
A person who seeks to enter Canada at a port of entry or who makes an application at an inland 
office that they should be authorized to enter or remain in Canada, as the case may be, must 
truthfully provide such information as an officer may require for the purpose of the examination. 
As such persons are subject to examination, there is a legal obligation under A16(1) to answer 
truthfully all questions put to them by an officer for the purpose of the examination, and produce 
all documents or other evidence reasonably required. 
 
R37 specifies the point at which the examination of a person who seeks to enter Canada, or 
makes an application to transit through Canada, ends. Generally, examinations will end when 
an officer makes a decision on the application before them or, in cases referred to the MD, 
when a determination has been made.  For refugee claimants, however, R37(2) provides 
designated officers the authority to examine a refugee claimant until the refugee claim has been 
determined by the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the IRB. The same obligation to 
answer truthfully applies to persons claiming to be refugees who are referred for a determination 
of eligibility pursuant to A100(1.1).  
 
While there is no way of compelling persons to comply with the legal obligation to provide 
truthful information, under the IRPA it is an offence to knowingly provide false or misleading 
information under A127 (Misrepresentation). 
 
It should be noted by officers at the port of entry that while permanent residents are subject to 
examination when seeking entry, the IRPA gives permanent residents of Canada the right to 
enter Canada at a port of entry pursuant to A19(2) once the officer is satisfied that the person 
holds permanent resident status. The obligation to answer truthfully under A16(1) for permanent

25 
2025-02-20 
residents is linked to A18(1) and must be related to examination for the purpose of establishing 
that the person holds permanent resident status in Canada.   
 
While an officer who is satisfied at examination that a person holds permanent resident status 
must admit that person, the officer may also form an opinion during examination that the 
permanent resident is inadmissible for other reasons under the IRPA. In such cases, the officer 
should advise the person that while it has been established that they have a right to enter 
Canada, there are reasons to believe that they could become the subject of a report under the 
IRPA which could lead to the issuance of a removal order. If the person wishes to continue 
answering questions or providing information/submissions pertaining to the allegation, they 
should be given an opportunity but are not required to do so. Even if a permanent resident 
becomes the subject of an A44(1) report, they continue to have a right to enter until a final 
determination has been made regarding their loss of status. 
 
For further details on examination, see ENF 5 Writing 44(1) reports and ENF 4 Port of entry 
examinations. 
 
 
 
8 Scope of Discretion of the Minister’s Delegate 
8.1 Minister’s Delegate Options— Limited discretion of the MD at A44(2) 
 
Where the MD reviews the A44(1) report and finds that it is well-founded, there are 
circumstances in which the objectives of the IRPA may be achieved without the issuance of a 
removal order. The MD has the discretion to take other action within the exercise of their 
delegated authority as set out in the IRPA and the IRPR. However, as will be seen in this 
section, the scope of discretion of the MD is limited. 
 
The use of the word “may” in the IRPA suggests that Parliament intended to provide the officer 
and the MD with some discretion on decisions made under A44(1) and A44(2). While the body 
of case law respecting this scope of discretion varies, Canadian jurisprudence does affirm that 
an MD’s discretion under A44 is limited. 
 
The discretion under A44(1) and A44(2) does not mean that officers and MDs can disregard the 
fact that someone is, or may be, inadmissible. The discretion under A44 is meant to give officers 
and MDs some flexibility in managing cases where circumstances warrant that no removal order 
will be sought and where the objectives of the IRPA may or will be achieved without the need to 
write an inadmissibility report under A44(1) or issue a removal order/refer the case to the ID 
under A44(2).  
 
The courts have also found that this scope of discretion varies depending on the inadmissibility 
grounds alleged, whether the person concerned is a permanent resident or a foreign national, 
and whether the MD or the ID has the authority to issue a removal order. In other words, the 
scope of discretion has been viewed as “variable and flexible”.7 
 
For example, in the case of Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. 
Cha, 2006 FCA 126, a case involving a foreign national inadmissible under paragraph 36(2)(a) 
                                                          
7 Sharma v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2016 FCA 319 


===== PAGE 26 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) 
26 
2025-02-20 
of the IRPA, the FCA held that in spite of the use of the word “may” in the wording of subsection 
A44(2), there are limits to the discretion afforded to officers and MDs. The FCA held that with 
respect to foreign nationals inadmissible for criminality or serious criminality, officers and MDs 
have limited discretion under A44(1) and A44(2). The Court further outlined that the particular 
circumstances of the foreign national, the nature of the offence, the conviction, and the 
sentence are beyond the scope of the discretionary power of the officer when considering 
whether or not to write an A44(1) report for criminality or serious criminality against a foreign 
national. The FCA also concluded that permanent residents have more rights and therefore 
benefit from more discretion by decision-makers than foreign nationals do.   
 
More recent jurisprudence8 confirms that officers and MDs making decisions under A44 have 
very limited discretion on whether to refer a case for an admissibility hearing, particularly in 
matters concerning serious criminality and organized criminality, and that there is no obligation 
for officers or MDs to consider factors related to H&C or ‘personal circumstances’. These 
decisions also confirm that at this the 44 stage, officers and MDs are conducting a fact-finding 
mission into “readily and objectively ascertainable facts” and that this administrative screening 
function applies to both foreign nationals and permanent residents. 
 
In general, discretion under A44 means that officers and MDs have some flexibility in managing 
cases where the person is inadmissible, however the objectives of the IRPA may or will be 
achieved without the need to write a report under A44(1) or, at the MD level, issue a removal 
order or A44(2) referral, for example:  
 
 
where an MD allows a withdrawal of an application to enter Canada (Allowed to Leave) 
option at a port of entry after an A44(1) report has been written; 
 
where a person is already subject to an enforceable removal order and the MD 
determines that the objectives of the IRPA would not be served by the issuance of an 
additional removal order and determines that a disposition of “no further action” on the 
A44(2) report would be appropriate; 
 
where an MD decides to issue a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) to a foreign national 
taking into account the relevant assessment risk factors set out in agency and 
departmental guidance (e.g., foreign national who is seeking entry to work in Canada 
and who was convicted of a non-violent offence many years ago);  
 
where the MD holds the A44(2) review in abeyance pending the decision on an 
application to IRCC for restoration of status by a foreign national who has remained in 
Canada beyond the period authorized; or 
 
where the MD decides that the issuance of a warning letter for a permanent resident or 
protected person reported under A36(1) is warranted, in consideration of all of the 
circumstances of the case, including the objectives under paragraphs A3(1)(h) and (i) of 
the IRPA.

8.2 Priority Cases: Inadmissibility under A34, A35, A35.1, A36 and A37 of the IRPA 
It was affirmed by the FCA in Sharma v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 
2016 FCA 319, that within the context of A44, officers and the MD must always be mindful of 
Parliament’s intention in drafting the IRPA to make security of Canadians a top priority. 
In Sharma, the FCA also concluded that the FCA’s rationale in Cha in support of a limited 
discretion under A44 would appear to apply equally to both foreign nationals and permanent 
residents. 
 
Although the factors contained in these guidelines may be considered at the A44(2) stage, 
officers and MDs must always be mindful of the various objectives of the IRPA, in particular 
A3(1)(h) and (i). As suggested by Federal Court jurisprudence, in cases of inadmissibility under 
A34 to A37, the scope of discretion enjoyed by officers and MDs making a decision under A44 
will be very narrow and generally it is reasonably open to officers and MDs to prioritize public 
safety and security.  
8.3 Special considerations for protected persons 
 
Under the IRPA, protected persons are provided with certain protections, including the right of 
non-refoulement under A115(1) and, subject to A64, the right under A63(3) to appeal to the IAD 
against a decision to make a removal order against them. This was recognized by Justice 
Décary in Cha, who noted that the Act and the Regulations treat permanent residents differently 
than Convention Refugees who are, in turn, treated differently than other foreign nationals.      
 
It should be noted that the Federal Court jurisprudence would support that protected persons 
are not entitled to a higher degree of procedural fairness or participatory rights with respect to 
the operation of A44 than other foreign nationals or permanent residents [see Awed v. Canada 
(Citizenship and Immigration) 2006 FC 469].  Officers and MDs should also keep in mind that 
the Federal Court has made findings to support the principle that officials carrying out A44(1) 
and (2) assessments are not obliged to speculate about how and when future deportation might 
take place [Faci v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2011 FC 693]. 
 
In cases of protected persons, the MD may also consider as an additional factor in their 
assessment, whether the facts of the case would support a referral for a Ministerial opinion 
(‘Danger Opinion’) under A115(2). For further information, see ENF 5, section 14.5, ‘Overview:  
Minister's opinions/interventions’. 
 
 
9 Charter considerations 
 
The purpose of this section is to provide guidance to officials performing MD functions under 
A44(2) in handling Charter and/or constitutional arguments made in the course of A44(2) 
proceedings.  
 
The jurisprudence respecting the application of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 9 
(Charter) at the A44(2) stage is in a state of flux.10 Therefore, current guidance to MDs is 
constrained by the evolving state of the law in this area. 
                                                          
9 Constitution Act, 1982, Part I Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms 
 
10 For example, see Revell v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FCA 262; 


===== PAGE 28 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2)

2025-02-20 
Existing case law establishes that all administrative decision-making must be consistent with the 
Charter.11  Under the IRPA, this requirement has been incorporated into the objectives of the Act 
under A3(3)(d).  
 
Where a person specifically alleges that a provision of IRPA or its application (i.e., decision of 
the MD to issue a removal order or refer the report to the Immigration Division ID for an 
admissibility hearing) breaches one or more enumerated Charter right, the MD must address 
these Charter concerns in their written decision. This was affirmed by the Federal Court in its 
decision in Abdi v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2018 FC 733. In 
other words, the MD cannot ignore Charter arguments. This does not mean, however, that MDs 
are expected to engage in a complex Charter analysis within the context of A44(2) decisions. 
 
In most cases, the courts have found that the specific Charter rights being raised do not apply at 
the A44(2) admissibility stage, that is, it is premature to say at the A44 stage that the MD’s 
decision will impact these enumerated Charter rights. For example, in Brar v. Canada, 2016 FC 
1214, the Federal Court expressed doubts that section 7 rights could be engaged by the A44(2) 
referral decision, and, in a related case, reiterated that section 7 rights are not engaged at the 
referral stage (Brar v. Canada, 2017 FC 820).  
 
 
MDs should keep in mind that the courts have found that the objectives of the IRPA 
indicate Parliament’s intent to prioritize the security of Canadians. 12  
 
MDs should note that the Federal Court has found that the MD is not obliged to 
speculate about how and when a future deportation might take place or engage in a 
section A25 (H&C considerations) or a section A112 (Pre-Removal Risk Assessment) 
analysis.13 
 
Where a person specifically mentions a breach of their Charter rights in either 
verbal or written submissions, the MD should record this in their notes and address it 
in their reasons, even if only to say that they do not find that specific Charter rights are 
engaged at this stage and provide supporting reasons.  
 
Constitutional arguments about legislation:  
 
In cases where the person concerned is challenging the constitutionality of a provision of the 
IRPA itself:  
 
CBSA and IRCC officials do not have jurisdiction to grant Charter remedies under 
section 52 of the Constitution Act or under section 24 of the Charter.14

“have been infringed or denied may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such remedy as 
the court considers appropriate and just in the circumstances”.  Pursuant to subsection 52(1) of the 
Constitution Act, a court may also strike down a legislated provision which is found to infringe a person’s 
Charter rights as invalid. Subsection 24(1) of the Charter relates to personal remedies for a government

 
Where the MD is specifically asked to rule on the constitutionality of A44(2) or another 
provision under the IRPA, the MD should indicate in their decision that they do not have 
the authority to do so and such a remedy should be sought in a court of competent 
jurisdiction.  
 
If the MD is requested to delay A44(2) procedures so that the person concerned may 
make an application to the Federal Court on the constitutionality of a provision under the 
IRPA, the MD should, in deciding the request, consider that the legal process permits an 
application to the Federal Court to be made following the decision on eligibility or 
admissibility. Consequently, there is no reason, based on a constitutional argument, for 
the MD to permit a delay of procedures for the purpose of pursuing a Federal Court 
application. 
 
 
10 Cases where the MD has jurisdiction to issue a removal order 
10.1 Procedural fairness considerations 
 
The purpose of A44(2) proceedings is for the MD to review the A44(1) report to determine 
whether the report is well-founded. In prescribed circumstances set out in the Regulations, 
where the MD determines that the A44(1) report is well-founded, the MD has the authority to 
issue a removal order.    
 
In cases where the MD has the authority to issue a removal order, the MD will need to ensure 
that certain steps are completed to ensure that procedural fairness has been met. 
 
During in-person proceedings before the MD, the person concerned must be informed of the 
purpose of the A44(2) interview/proceeding and the possible outcomes of it. Prior to a 
substantive review, the MD must also give the person concerned the opportunity to obtain the 
services of an interpreter where one is necessary and the MD must ensure that the person 
concerned understands the proceedings. In certain circumstances, such as where the person 
concerned is detained, the officer must also explain the right to counsel and ensure that an 
opportunity to be represented by counsel has been provided. 
 
Persons must be informed of the nature of the allegations regarding their inadmissibility 
contained in the A44(1) report(s) at the earliest opportunity, and must be given a reasonable 
opportunity to respond to those allegations before a removal order is issued. 
 
It is important for the MD to make notes detailing the process followed in exercising their 
decision-making powers. Where the MD is utilizing the case highlights form (BSF516 or 
IMM5084B) to record their decision, the form should be completed in as much detail as 
possible). 
 
For further detail on procedures during in-person proceedings, see Appendix C: Steps to be 
completed during in-person A44(2) proceedings where the MD has jurisdiction to issue a 
removal order.  
                                                          
action which breaches Charter rights, whereas subsection 52(1) would apply where legislation is found to 
be invalid. MDs are not considered a court of competent jurisdiction and therefore cannot grant a remedy 
under section 24 of the Charter.

10.2 Types of administrative removal orders  
 
The IRPA and IRPR contain provisions regarding the issuance of removal orders for persons 
who are found to be inadmissible on one of the grounds listed in the IRPA.   
 
R223 provides for three types of removal orders that may be issued: 
 
 
departure order;  
 
exclusion order; and 
 
deportation order.  
 
R228 specifies the type of removal order that the MD is authorized to make in prescribed 
circumstances for certain inadmissibility provisions. It is important to note that the Regulations 
do not distinguish between removal orders that are in force under the IRPA and those that are 
not (conditional) and it is A49 which specifies when removal orders come into force. 
 
Table 5:   Types of removal orders  
 
Departure Order 
R224(2) 
 
Requires the person to leave Canada within 30 days after the 
order becomes enforceable. 
 
Becomes a deportation order by operation of law when the person 
does not meet the requirements set out under R240(1)(a) to (c) 
within 30 days after the order becomes enforceable.  
Exclusion Order 
R225 
 
A person who has been removed on an exclusion order cannot 
return to Canada for one (1) year* unless the person obtains the 
required written authorization to return 
*If the exclusion order issued as a result of the application of 
A40(2)(a) (misrepresentation), the exclusion period is five (5) 
years 
Deportation Order 
R226 
 
Permanently bars the person from returning to Canada, unless the 
person obtains the required written authorization to return 
10.3 Permanent residents and their residency obligation— R228(2) 
 
Pursuant to the IRPR, the MD has the authority to issue removal orders against permanent 
residents only in cases where the inadmissibility is based on a failure to comply with the 
residency obligations under A28. The authority of the MD does not include the issuance of 
removal orders for permanent residents on other grounds of inadmissibility.

Before the MD issues a departure order against a permanent resident, paragraph A28(2)(c) 
specifically requires the MD to determine whether humanitarian and compassionate 
considerations, including the best interests of any child affected by the decision, overcome any 
breach of the residency obligation.   
 
The MD is required to consider all information presented by the permanent resident on a case-
by-case basis. The following are examples of considerations the MD may consider in 
determining whether humanitarian and compassionate grounds justify the retention of 
permanent resident status. The MD is to consider circumstances and events that occurred in the 
last five-year period which led to the permanent resident’s non-compliance with the residency 
obligation. 
 
Examples of factors to weigh under A28(2)(c) 
 
i.  Extent of non-compliance: 
 
 
What is the number of days of physical presence in Canada within the five-year period 
under examination? 
 
Was any period of time outside of Canada due to a medical condition or the medical 
condition of a close family member? Could alternative arrangements for the care of the 
family member have been made?  
 
ii. Circumstances beyond the person’s control: 
 
 
Are the circumstances for remaining outside of Canada compelling? 
 
Were there circumstances which prevented the permanent resident from returning to 
Canada? 
 
Has the permanent resident returned to Canada at the earliest opportunity? 
 
Did the permanent resident leave as a child accompanying a dependent?  If so, is the 
permanent resident returning at the earliest possible opportunity?  Did the permanent 
resident accompany a parent because of a mental or physical disability? 
 
iii. Establishment in and outside Canada: 
 
 
Is the permanent resident a citizen or permanent resident of another country? 
 
Has the permanent resident taken steps to establish permanence in a country other than 
Canada? 
 
To what degree is the permanent resident established in Canada? 
 
What ties to Canada has the permanent resident maintained? 
 
iv. Presence and degree of consequential hardship: 
 
 
What is the degree of hardship caused by the loss of permanent resident status in 
relation to the permanent resident’s personal circumstances?  What is the impact on 
family members, especially children?

10.4 Removal order for refugee claimants— R228(3) 
 
R228(3) provides that where a removal order issued with respect to a person who has made a 
claim for refugee protection which has been determined to be eligible to be referred to the 
Refugee Protection Division (RPD) or no eligibility determination has been made, a departure 
order is the applicable removal order in prescribed circumstances. 
 
A49(2) provides that a removal order made against a refugee protection claimant is conditional 
and prescribes the circumstances under which the removal order will come into force.  
 
Note:  MDs should keep in mind that there are special procedures for vulnerable persons and  
refer to the IRCC Program delivery instructions on Processing in-Canada claims for refugee 
protection of minors and vulnerable persons. 
10.5 Dual intent  
 
A22(2) states that the intention of a foreign national to become a permanent resident does not 
preclude them from becoming a temporary resident if the officer is satisfied that the person will 
leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.  
 
Dual intent is present when a foreign national who has applied for permanent residence in 
Canada (or is entitled to apply for permanent residence within Canada) also seeks to enter 
Canada for a temporary period as a visitor, worker or student. If an officer has concerns/doubts 
about the foreign national’s bona fides, the foreign national must be made aware of these 
concerns and given an opportunity to respond to them.  
 
Some examples of dual intent could include: 
 
 
a foreign national frequently visiting a Canadian spouse who has complied with previous 
conditions of entry and is otherwise not inadmissible, even if an application for 
permanent residence has not yet been submitted; 
 
a foreign national who has applied or intends to apply for permanent residence, but is 
visiting Canada to assess employment opportunities, setting up household, etc. 
The Federal Court in Rebmann v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2005 FC 301 held that an officer 
is required to take into account the foreign national's dual intent in entering/remaining in Canada 
as a temporary resident and provide analysis of the relevant evidence with regards to the 
foreign national’s intention to establish permanent residence in Canada to show that the foreign 
national will not leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay as a temporary 
resident. 
 
Officers and MDs should distinguish between a foreign national whose intentions are bona fide 
and a foreign national who has no intention of leaving Canada at the end of their authorized stay 
if the application for permanent residence is refused.  
 
The possibility that a foreign national may, at some point in the future, be approved for 
permanent residence does not absolve the individual from meeting the requirements of a 
temporary resident, specifically, to leave Canada at the end of the period authorized for their 
stay, in accordance with section R179.

2025-02-20 
In assessing the foreign national’s intentions, officers and MDs should weigh all the factors 
relevant to the case, including the length of time the applicant has spent in Canada, the means 
of support; obligations and ties in the home country, previous compliance with requirements of 
the IRPA and any compassionate circumstances of the person concerned. These factors should 
be considered before proceeding with administrative enforcement action under A44(1) or 
A44(2).   
 
Officers are reminded to use their own judgment and the flexibility afforded to them by 
subsection A22(2) when making decisions on cases where the foreign national also has the 
intention to become a permanent resident. 
 
For further guidance on assessing dual intent considerations, see IRCC Program delivery 
instructions on Dual intent.  See also:  ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. 
10.6 Restoration of status 
 
R182 describes a mechanism by which a visitor, worker or student who has lost temporary 
resident status for having failed to comply with any of the conditions imposed under R185(a), 
R185(b)(i) to (iii) or R185(c), may nevertheless submit an application within the 90-day period of 
the loss of their status, and if eligible have that status restored.  
 
It is important to note that under the D & D instruments, only IRCC officials have the authority to 
consider an application for restoration of status. 
 
The application submitted to IRCC shall be approved if the processing officer is satisfied that the 
foreign national continues to meet the initial requirements of their stay, and has not failed to 
comply with any other conditions imposed and is not the subject of a declaration made under 
A22.1. It is to be noted that an officer shall not restore the status of a student if the student is not 
in compliance with a condition set out in R220.1(1). 
 
Note:  If a temporary resident has applied for an extension of their authorized status before the 
status expires, they are considered to have maintained status (formerly referred to as “implied 
status”) until a decision is made on their application. Maintained status works by operation of 
law [R183(5)], and the temporary resident cannot be reported for non-compliance until a 
decision is made on their application for an extension, unless other IRPA inadmissibilities are 
present. For further details regarding procedures for persons with maintained status, see IRCC 
Program delivery instructions on Temporary residents: Maintained status during processing 
(previously called implied status). 
 
The following guidelines must be taken into account by Inland Enforcement Officers and MDs 
prior to taking enforcement action in such cases:  
Scenario 1:  Foreign national is out of status, but has applied for restoration of status 
within the 90-day period and is otherwise admissible – decision pending 
 
Foreign nationals who have submitted an application to have their status restored within the 90-
day period, and who are not inadmissible under any other section of the Act or Regulations, 
should not be subject to an A44(1) report. In such circumstances, officers and MDs must allow 
for a decision to be rendered by IRCC before taking enforcement action, an approach which is 
consistent with the Federal Court’s findings in Sui v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and 
Emergency Preparedness), 2006 FC 1314. 


===== PAGE 34 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) 
34 
2025-02-20 
Scenario 2:  Foreign national is out of status and has not applied for restoration of status 
but is still within 90-day eligibility period 
 
While there is nothing in the IRPA or the Regulations that prohibits an officer from writing an 
A44(1) report or an MD from issuing an exclusion order during the 90-day restoration period 
where no application for restoration has yet been made, officers and MDs should consider 
whether or not to pursue enforcement action in such cases. After taking appropriate steps to 
ensure that a restoration application has not been made, should an officer decide to write an 
A44(1) report and refer it to the MD for review, the officer should articulate their reasoning in 
pursuing enforcement action in the decision, if such action is pursued prior to the expiration of 
the 90-day eligibility period.  
 
Where the MD receives an A44(1) report for non-compliance within the 90-day restoration 
period where the foreign national has not filed an application but is otherwise admissible, the 
MD must then consider R182 and has the discretion to hold the report in abeyance until the 90-
day eligibility period has lapsed. If the MD decides to proceed with the A44(2) review, the MD 
should verify whether a restoration application has been or will be filed, and must consider all 
the circumstances of the case, including the fact that the foreign national is within the 90-day 
restoration period.   
 
This approach is consistent with the Federal Court’s decision in Ouedraogo v. Canada (Public 
Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2016 FC 810 where the Court noted that the discretion 
of a MD to issue an exclusion order and the ability of a foreign national to apply for restoration of 
status are not mutually exclusive – both can occur at the same time. The Court found that the 
simple existence of an application for restoration does not in and of itself shield a foreign 
national against enforcement action. In short, where an application for restoration is made, 
although the existence of the application should be taken into consideration by the MD when 
they are exercising their discretion, there is nothing prohibiting the MD from nonetheless making 
an inadmissibility finding where the foreign national is found to be non-compliant with the 
requirements set out in R185. 
 
In order to adhere to the principles of procedural fairness and natural justice, officers and MDs 
must consider each case on its own merits and may consider the following: 
 
 
Does the foreign national state that they wish to remain in Canada and for what 
purpose? 
 
Has the foreign national already made arrangements to depart Canada in the immediate 
future? 
 
Is the foreign national evasive about their departure plans or the intent to remain in 
Canada? 
 
Has the foreign national otherwise been in compliance with the terms and conditions of 
their temporary resident status? 
 
If the foreign national has not applied for a restoration of status, is the officer/MD 
satisfied that the foreign national will appear for future immigration interviews and/or 
depart Canada voluntarily? 
 
If the officer/MD is satisfied that the foreign national will seek to remedy lapsed status 
within the 90-day period, then the officer/MD may wish to allow the 90-day application 
period to lapse before reviewing the case again in consideration of enforcement action.

Scenario 3:  Foreign national is out of status beyond the 90-day restoration of status 
eligibility period, or is otherwise inadmissible under the IRPA or Regulations 
 
If an officer encounters a foreign national who has overstayed their authorized period of stay 
beyond the 90-day eligibility period for applying for restoration of status, or where the foreign 
national is otherwise inadmissible under the IRPA or Regulations, the officer may pursue 
appropriate enforcement action, which includes writing an A44(1) report and referring it to the 
MD for a review under A44(2). 
10.7 Procedure: Reviewing A44(1) reports when a Minister’s Delegate is not on 
site  
 
Officers cannot prepare and then review their own A44(1) report under the IRPA. In those 
circumstances where a MD is not physically on-site and/or otherwise available to conduct a 
review under A44(2) in person and deferring the proceeding is not a viable option, officers must 
contact an off-site MD for the purpose of reviewing the A44(1) report and conducting a 
determination under A44(2) by telephone or videoconference.  
 
In all A44(2) reviews not conducted in person, the MD will need to review the A44(1) report in 
GCMS as well as any case notes or accompanying documents that the officer has uploaded into 
GCMS. The officer who contacts the MD must also ensure that their recommendation and any 
supporting evidence has also been provided to the MD prior to the commencement of the 
A44(2) proceeding. The officer must also make notes during the MD review and fully document 
the procedural steps taken throughout all stages of the proceedings.  
 
The MD is required to follow all steps for conducting the MD review and enter detailed 
examination or application notes into the GCMS that fully support the decision being made. MDs 
may refer to section 22 of this manual chapter, ‘Entering MD decisions into GCMS’. Where the 
MD also makes handwritten notes during the proceedings, these should be forwarded to the 
officer holding the file and/or uploaded into GCMS. 
 
In those cases where the MD has jurisdiction to issue a removal order, officers and MDs must 
be particularly diligent in ensuring that all matters relating to natural justice and procedural 
fairness are satisfied and documented in notes. 
 
In cases where the MD has jurisdiction to issue a removal order and if, for any reason, the 
opportunity does not exist for the person concerned to communicate directly with the MD, or if 
the MD is of the opinion that the person concerned does not truly appreciate the nature of the 
proceedings, then the A44(2) proceeding must be postponed until a MD is physically on site to 
conduct the A44(2) review in person.  
 
If the MD makes a decision to issue a removal order pursuant to R228, the MD will enter the 
decision into GCMS and the officer who has the person concerned before them can print the 
removal order and provide it to the person concerned.  
 
Note: If, for any reason, the MD has made a decision not to proceed with or otherwise continue 
the MD review under A44(2), the officer is not to contact other MDs.

10.8 Procedure: Issuing removal orders to persons in absentia 
 
In absentia is Latin for "in the absence of".  
 
In the context of A44(2), the practical application of an in absentia proceeding will be in those 
exceptional circumstances when persons who are subject to an A44(2) Minister’s proceeding 
have a removal order made against them without being present at the time the removal order is 
issued. 
 
A55(1) allows for the issuance of a warrant for the arrest and detention of a foreign national or 
permanent resident where there are reasonable grounds to believe the person is inadmissible 
and unlikely to appear “at a proceeding that could lead to the making of a removal order by 
the Minister under subsection 44(2)”.   
 
As officers have the authority to issue a warrant for a person unlikely to appear at A44(2) 
proceedings in cases where the MD has jurisdiction to issue the removal order, removal orders 
should not be issued in absentia, unless under exceptional circumstances. These cases will 
be rare, and each will need to be assessed on an individual basis taking into consideration all 
relevant information before proceeding with an in absentia proceeding.  
 
The following scenario illustrates an example of exceptional circumstances where an in absentia 
proceeding may be reasonable. 
 
Scenario: 
 
A foreign national entered Canada as a member of a crew and shortly after deserted 
their vessel. The crew member did not report to CBSA or IRCC within the specified time 
frames under the Regulations and was reported under A44(1). In an attempt to locate 
the person in Canada, all investigative leads were exhausted. The A44(2) proceeding 
was held in absentia and after reviewing all the evidence, the report was determined to 
be well-founded and the person was issued a removal order and a warrant for removal. 
 
This approach is consistent with the FCA’s findings in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. 
Jayamaha Mudalige Don, 2014 FCA 4. While the FCA concluded that it was open to the MD to 
issue the removal order, the court’s finding that procedural fairness was not breached was 
based on the specific facts of the case (i.e., immigration officials had NO contact information for 
the person, more than 72 hours had elapsed from the time when the person deserted his ship 
and subparagraph 228(1)(c)(v) of the Regulations expressly provided for the issuance of a 
removal order). It is important to note that the FCA placed great weight on the fact that the 
person concerned had an obligation to report to CBSA or IRCC and failed to do so and the 
coordinates of the person concerned in that case were NOT known to CBSA/IRCC and 
therefore the person was incapable of being notified.   
 
Notification when scheduling A44(2) proceedings 
 
Not all A44(2) proceedings will take place on the same day that the A44(1) report is written, for 
number of reasons. In some cases, a person may be reported pursuant to A44(1), and the 
review of that report by a MD will not take place until a MD is available. In these situations, 
reasonable efforts shall be made to notify the person to appear and provide an opportunity to be 
heard at the A44(2) proceeding. ‘Reasonable efforts' will vary from case to case depending on 


===== PAGE 37 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) 
37 
2025-02-20 
the nature of the case, type of information available and the level of engagement with the 
person concerned. 
 
 
Where the person's address is known, officers shall provide written notice in-person or 
mail, depending on the circumstances, by completing a Notice to Appear for a 
Proceeding under A44(2) [IMM 1234B or BSF504]. This form will provide notice of the 
location, date and time of the A44(2) Minister's proceeding; legal authority to conduct the 
proceeding; and consequences of failing to appear at the proceeding. Other relevant 
information such as a copy of the A44(1) report which sets out the allegation(s) and 
contact information should also be provided. 
 
If the notice is being mailed, reasonable efforts shall be made to verify the accuracy of 
the person's address; this includes querying and updating databases. Reasonable time 
and opportunity shall be provided to the person to allow for attendance at the A44(2) 
proceeding. 
 
Failure to Appear at 44(2) Proceedings 
 
 
If the person fails to attend on the date specified, the MD conducting the review shall 
adjourn the proceeding. Reasonable efforts shall be made to determine the reasons for 
the no-show (e.g. letter to the last known address, site visit and/or telephone call). 
 
In some circumstances, there will be valid excuses as to why the person failed to 
appear. The onus will be on the person to show cause for not appearing at the 
proceeding. Officers shall make a determination as to whether the explanation is 
reasonable and attempt to communicate the results of that determination to the person. 
 
If satisfied of the explanation for not attending the proceeding, a second written notice 
[IMM 1234B or BSF504] will be delivered in-person or by mail, depending on the 
circumstances. Officers must clearly write or otherwise indicate "second notice" on the 
form. 
 
If, following the second call-in notice there is no communication from the person 
concerned and/or their legal representative explaining their absence and if the 
inadmissibility allegation falls within the MD’s jurisdiction to issue a removal order 
(R228), the MD may pursue the issuance of an arrest warrant for being unlikely to 
appear for an A44(2) proceeding that could lead to the making of a removal order. 
 
For allegations where the jurisdiction to issue a removal order rests with the ID, it is open 
to the MD to refer the A44(1) report to ID for an admissibility hearing and consider 
issuing a warrant for admissibility hearing pursuant to A55(1) (see ENF 7 Immigration 
Investigations and IRPA s.55 Arrests/Detention for further details). 
 
Note: IRCC officers may refer cases for warrant issuance to CBSA for review. All such 
referrals must include all details of attempts made to contact the person concerned and 
copies of all call-in notices sent and case notes. 
 
In exceptional cases where there is detailed information on file that the person 
concerned was aware of the A44(2) proceeding (e.g., person was served with the call-in 
notice in-person and understood the consequences, the A44(2) proceeding was initiated 
by the MD but had to be postponed due to unavailability of the person’s counsel and the 
person concerned was fully aware of the new date, etc.) the MD may proceed to conduct 
a review under A44(2) in absentia.  


===== PAGE 38 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) 
38 
2025-02-20 
 
In those exceptional cases where the MD proceeds with the A44(2) review in absentia, 
the MD will be required to conduct a paper review of the A44(1) report with all relevant 
evidence available at the time of the A44(2) review. If, after such review, the MD 
determines the A44(1) report to be well-founded, and if all grounds of inadmissibility are 
those for which the MD has jurisdiction, a removal order may be made against the 
person concerned even though the person is not present at the time the removal order is 
issued. 
10.9 A44(1) reports for inadmissible family members 
 
Under A42, accompanying and non-accompanying family members may be inadmissible to 
Canada under prescribed circumstances. This provision may only apply to family members who 
are foreign nationals, other than protected persons. 
 
Where an officer writes an A44(1) report against a family member for inadmissibility under A42, 
the MD has jurisdiction under R228 to issue the applicable removal order.  Officers and MDs 
should note, however, that for the purposes of A52(1), the making of a removal order against a 
foreign national on the basis of inadmissibility under A42 is a prescribed circumstance that does 
not oblige the foreign national to obtain the authorization of an officer in order to return to 
Canada.  
 
It is important to note that A42 may only form the basis of an A44(1) report when the person is 
inadmissible under sections A34, A35, A35.1, or A37. 
 
Procedure to include family members on ID removal order 
 
R227 sets out that, for the purposes of section 42 of the Act, a report prepared under A44(1)  
against a foreign national is also a report against the foreign national’s family members in 
Canada.  
 
R227(2) provides that, in the case of a removal order made by the ID against a foreign national 
who has family members in Canada, the removal order issued by the ID against a foreign 
national may also be made effective against the family members without the need for a separate 
inadmissibility report provided that an officer informed the family member(s): 
 
of the report; 
 
that they are the subject of an admissibility hearing and, consequently, have the right to 
make submissions and be represented, at their own expense, at the admissibility 
hearing; and 
 
that they are inadmissible under A42 on grounds of being an inadmissible family 
member. 
 
While this procedural avenue may be available under the Regulations, it is generally 
recommended that where an officer decides to pursue enforcement action against inadmissible 
family members of a foreign national under A42, the officer should proceed by way of writing a 
separate A44(1) inadmissibility report for each family member after the removal order has been 
made against the foreign national. It is also to be noted that this avenue is not available in cases 
involving allegations within the jurisdiction of the MD.

Note:  the MD only has the authority to issue removal orders against persons against whom an 
A44(1) report has been written. The MD cannot include family members in an administrative 
removal order relating to another member of the family.  
10.10 Procedure: Removal orders following vacation or cessation of 
refugee/protected person status by RPD  
 
R228(1)(b) allows the MD to issue removal orders to foreign nationals who are inadmissible for 
misrepresentation under A40(1)(c) on a final determination by the RPD to vacate a decision to 
allow the person’s claim for refugee protection or application for protection pursuant to A109.   
 
Under A109(1), the RPD may, on application by the Minister, vacate a decision to allow a claim 
for refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly 
misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter.   
 
R228(1)(b.1) allows the MD to issue removal orders to foreign nationals who are inadmissible 
under A40.1(1) on a final determination by the RPD under A108(2) that the refugee protection of 
the foreign national has ceased (i.e., cessation of refugee protection).   
 
Pursuant to A46 a person loses permanent resident status on a final determination by the RPD:  
 
 
to vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection or application for protection 
[A46(1)(d)]; or  
 
that their refugee protection has ceased under A108(2) for any of the reasons described 
in paragraphs A108(1)(a) to (d) [A46(1)(c.1)]. 
The MD should only issue the applicable removal order once all court challenges to the decision 
by the RPD to vacate the refugee protection claim or cease refugee protection have been 
exhausted and are resolved.  
 
Note: following a decision of the RPD that refugee protection has ceased under A108(2), the 
Minister may not simply rely on a previous removal order (issued against the person before 
protected person status was granted) to remove that person. In other words, a new A44(1) 
report based on inadmissibility under A40.1(1) would need to be written and a new removal 
order would need to be issued by the MD in these circumstances. 
 
Following a decision by the RPD to vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection or 
cease refugee protection, the foreign national has 15 days to apply for leave to the Federal 
Court for a judicial review as stipulated in A72(2). Therefore, the MD shall wait a minimum of 22 
days (seven days for receipt of a decision sent by mail and 15 days for the application under 
A72(2)) before issuing the removal order following the writing of an A44(1) report for 
inadmissibility under A40(1)(c) or A40.1(1).  
 
Where an application for leave to the Federal Court has been filed, the MD shall wait until the 
final decision is rendered and all legal means of challenging the decision have been exhausted 
and resolved. Prior to issuing the removal order, the MD shall ensure that no litigation regarding 
the RPD decision remains outstanding and that the minimum period of time to file an extension 
of time has elapsed without an application. The MD should seek the assistance of the regional

Justice Liaison officer with respect to the status of litigation and any issues regarding extensions 
of time. 
 
 
11 Temporary resident permits (TRPs) 
 
In some cases, a designated officer may exercise their authority under A24(1) to issue a TRP to 
allow a foreign national who is inadmissible or does not meet the requirements of the IRPA to 
enter or remain in Canada where it is justified in the circumstances. TRPs are always issued at 
the discretion of the designated authority and may be cancelled at any time. 
 
The authority to issue a TRP is determined by the IRCC Designation and Delegation (D & D) 
Instrument and depends on the nature of the allegation.  
 
Note:  For CBSA, TRPs may only be issued by designated officials at the port of entry 
There are instances where the person who has the delegated authority to review the A44 report 
(the MD) does not have the designated authority to issue a TRP.  In such cases, the official with 
authority to review the report (i.e., the MD) may make a recommendation to the person with the 
designated authority to issue a TRP.  
 
Officers and MDs may recommend or issue TRPs only in accordance with the Act and 
Regulations, and must follow the IRCC Program delivery instructions on Temporary resident 
permits. In all cases, officers and MDs must leave a record, which includes detailed notes 
entries in GCMS, of their decision or recommendation. For further information, see ENF 4 Port 
of entry examinations. 
 
TRPs should only be issued after careful consideration of all assessment factors as the 
document carries privileges greater than those accorded to other visitors, students and workers 
with temporary resident status. Before issuing a TRP, officials must consult the departmental 
and agency guidelines on risk assessment factors and procedures for issuing TRPs. This 
applies to both initial and subsequent TRPs. 
 
Where an officer does not have the authority to issue a TRP but has reviewed the case and is 
recommending the issuance of a TRP, the officer must prepare a written a case summary that 
includes a recommendation for a final decision. The officer will refer the case file to the decision-
maker with the designated authority to issue a TRP for a final determination. If the decision is 
made to issue a TRP, the decision-maker will determine the period of validity of the TRP.  
 
For further instructions and procedures for TRPs, officers must refer to the IRCC Program 
delivery Instructions on Temporary resident permits and ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. 
 
Additional considerations for TRP issuance: 
 
A person is not eligible for a TRP if less than 12 months have passed since their 
claim for refugee protection was last rejected [or determined to be withdrawn or 
abandoned as described under subsection A24(4)]. 
Exception: The one-year ban on accessing a TRP under A24(4) does not bar an 
IRCC officer, on their own initiative, from considering a TRP for a victim of human 
trafficking. 


===== PAGE 41 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) 
41 
2025-02-20 
 
There are specific IRCC policy guidelines respecting certain vulnerable persons 
including suspected or known victims of human trafficking and victims of family 
violence. Only IRCC officials may issue TRPs to victims of human trafficking or victims 
of family violence, however CBSA officials should follow the procedures set out in the 
Program delivery instructions above for handling these cases. 
 
If a student, worker or visitor with valid temporary resident status is reported 
under subsection A44(1) but a decision is made not to hold an admissibility hearing or 
issue a removal order, that person remains a temporary resident, and a TRP is not 
required. 
 
12 Allowing withdrawal of application to enter Canada/ Allowed to 
leave (Port of entry cases)   
 
Under R42, the officer who examines a foreign national who is seeking to enter Canada and 
who has indicated that they want to withdraw their application to enter Canada shall allow the 
foreign national to withdraw their application, unless R42(2) applies. 
 
R42(2) provides that a foreign national shall not be allowed to withdraw their application to enter 
Canada where a report under A44(1) is being prepared or has been prepared, unless the MD 
does not make a removal order or refer the report to the ID for an admissibility hearing.  
In other words, once an officer writes an A44(1) report, the allowed to leave option may only be 
exercised at the MD level.   
 
In exercising their discretion, the MD should consider whether the objectives of the IRPA are 
better served by allowing the person to voluntarily withdraw their application to enter Canada 
pursuant to R42 in the circumstances of the case. 
 
R42(3) provides that foreign nationals who are allowed to withdraw their application to enter 
Canada must appear without delay at a port of entry to verify their departure from Canada. 
If a person is allowed to leave Canada voluntarily, the officer or MD must give the person an 
Allowed to Leave Canada form (IMM 1282B). 
 
For further details regarding allowing persons to leave/withdraw their application to enter 
Canada:  see ENF 5, section 9. 4, ‘Allowing withdrawal of application to enter Canada/ Allowed 
to leave (Port of entry cases)’ and ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. 
 
 
13 Procedure: Handling possible claims for refugee protection 
 
Although there is no requirement in the IRPA for the MD to ask whether the subject of a 
determination wishes to make a claim for refugee protection, the MD should be aware of 
Canada's obligations under the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, 
and under the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or 
Punishment. 
 
A99(3) excludes persons under a removal order from making a claim for refugee protection. 
Therefore, the MD must ensure, before issuing a removal order under A44(2), that this would

42 
2025-02-20 
not be contrary to the spirit of Canada’s obligations, even when the individual does not explicitly 
request access to the refugee determination process.  
 
It must also be recognized that some people who may have a legitimate need of Canada’s 
protection are unaware of the provision for claiming refugee status.  
Handling a possible claim for refugee protection:  
 
Where the subject of a determination for an administrative removal order has not made a 
claim, the MD should ask them how long they intend to remain in Canada (port of entry 
cases) or when they intend to return to their home country (inland cases) or if there are 
any reasons why they are unable or unwilling to return to their home country. 
 
If the person indicates that their intention is or was to remain temporarily, the MD should 
proceed with the removal order decision and issue the removal order, if appropriate. 
 
If the person indicates that their intention is or was to remain in Canada indefinitely, the 
MD is to inquire about their motives for leaving their country of nationality/home country 
and the consequences of returning there before making a decision on issuing a removal 
order. 
 
Where the responses indicate a fear of returning to the country that may relate to 
refugee protection, the MD is to inform the person of the definition of a “Convention 
refugee” or “person in need of protection” as found in A96 and A97, and ask whether 
they wish to make a claim. 
 
Where the person indicates an intention not to make a claim, the MD should proceed 
with the decision and issue a removal order, if appropriate. 
 
Where the person is uncertain, the MD should inform them that they will not be able to 
make a claim for refugee protection after a removal order has been issued [A99(3)], and 
provide them with an opportunity to make the claim before proceeding with a removal 
order decision. 
 
If the person does not express an intent to make a claim, despite the explanation that 
this is their last opportunity, the MD should proceed with the decision and issue the 
removal order, if appropriate. 
 
Whenever the person indicates a fear of returning to their home country, the MD is to 
refrain from evaluating whether the fear is well-founded. As well, the MD must not 
speculate on  eligibility before the claim is made or speculate on the processing time or 
eventual outcome of a claim. 
These procedures do not preclude any person from making a claim for refugee protection at any 
time before a removal order is issued, regardless of the responses provided to the officer.  
In order to address concerns that may arise subsequent to the issuance of a removal order, it is 
important that the notes accurately reflect—in detail—the questions asked and the information 
provided by the person during the A44 proceedings. 
For further information on processing refugee claims, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations.

14 Persons claiming to be Canadian citizens or registered Indians 
under the Indian Act 
 
Under the IRPA, Canadian citizens and persons registered as Indians under the Indian Act have 
an unqualified right to enter and remain in Canada and are not subject to the inadmissibility 
provisions of IRPA. Therefore, before writing an A44(1) report, an officer should have evidence 
to confirm that the person does not hold such status.  
 
In cases of permanent residents, officers must confirm through the appropriate queries that the 
person has not obtained Canadian citizenship and ensure that due diligence has been 
exercised before proceeding with further enforcement action.  
 
Should the MD detect the possibility of Canadian citizenship or registered Indian status during 
the A44(2) proceedings, the MD shall cause an investigation of the matter to be initiated before 
making any removal order or referring the case to the ID for an admissibility hearing.  
 
 
15 Cases where the jurisdiction to issue a removal order rests with 
the Immigration Division  
 
In cases where the MD does not have jurisdiction to issue a removal order, the MD must 
determine whether to refer the A44(1) report to the ID if satisfied that the report is well-founded. 
At the end of the admissibility hearing, if satisfied that the person is inadmissible, the member of 
the ID shall, pursuant to A45(d), make the applicable removal order against the foreign national 
or permanent resident pursuant to R229. 
Before forming an opinion that a report is well-founded and referring it to the ID for an 
admissibility hearing, the MD must assess the case on its own merits. At the time of the MD’s 
assessment, the MD should have before them all submissions and documents filed by the 
person concerned as well as any evidence relied on by the reporting officer in their 
recommendation under A44(1). 
This section is intended to assist officers in making decisions that are consistent with the 
objectives of the IRPA; it is not intended to restrict the MD in the lawful exercise of their 
discretion. What follows are guidelines only.  
15.1 A44(1) reports for criminality cases 
In Medovarski v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration); Esteban v. Canada (Minister 
of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 51, the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) stated that 
the objectives in the IRPA reflect an intent to prioritize security and that this objective is given 
effect by removing persons with criminal records from Canada. The SCC noted that in drafting 
the IRPA, Parliament demonstrated a strong desire to treat criminals less leniently than under 
the former Immigration Act. This was noted in Sharma, where the FCA affirmed that officers and 
MDs, when dealing with matters under A44(1) and A44(2), must always be mindful of the 
various objectives of the IRPA, in particular A3(1)(h) and (i). The FCA also concluded that the 
Court’s rationale in Cha in support of a limited discretion under A44 would appear to apply 
equally to both foreign nationals and permanent residents. 
The MD should also be cognizant of how evidence of pending or existing charges was relied on 
by the reporting officer during the A44(1) assessment; the MD should be careful about how such 


===== PAGE 44 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) 
44 
2025-02-20 
evidence is relied on in the A44(2) decision. The MD must also be careful not to rely on 
convictions for which an application for rehabilitation or a record suspension has been granted 
as evidence of a criminal record.  For further information, see ENF 5 Writing 44(1) reports, 
section 12.2,  ‘Evidence of pending or withdrawn charges’. 
15.2 A44(1) reports concerning permanent residents of Canada  
As mentioned in section 8 above, the courts15 have confirmed that officers and MD’s making 
decisions under A44 have no obligation to consider H&C-like factors or ‘personal 
circumstances’ once inadmissibility is established by the evidence.  
 
Note: this section does not apply to PR residency obligation cases reported under A41(b). 
Before the MD issues a departure order against a permanent resident under R228(2), 
paragraph A28(2)(c) specifically requires the MD to determine whether humanitarian and 
compassionate considerations, including the best interests of any child affected by the decision, 
overcome any breach of the residency obligation [refer to section 10.3 Permanent residents and 
their residency obligation— R228(2)”]. 
 
During the course of A44 proceedings, however, an officer or MD may receive evidence or 
submissions relating to a permanent resident or protected person’s personal circumstances and 
why a removal order should not be sought. 
While the courts have affirmed that an MD is not required to consider personal circumstances, 
but if the MD does, such an assessment must be reasonable in the circumstances of the case. 
This means that if an MD exercises their discretion to consider personal factors, the assessment 
must be reasonable and the reasoning articulated. Where these factors are considered and 
rejected, an explanation of how these factors were assessed should be provided, even if only 
very brief in nature.16 An MD must ensure that the decision as a whole is “justifiable, 
transparent, and intelligible”17.  
Where the officer at A44(1) has exercised their discretion to consider personal circumstances in 
their recommendation, the MD must consider this information and explain in their decision 
whether or not they concur with the officer’s recommendation. To clarify, the MD is not bound by 
the A44(1) officer’s recommendation. For example, if the officer at A44(1) did NOT exercise 
their discretion to consider personal circumstances, this does not prevent the MD from 
exercising that discretion to consider such factors in the A44(2) decision. 
MDs should also provide reasons for giving more weight to certain documents over others 
where there is conflicting or inconsistent information before them. For example, where there are 
conflicting versions of events pertaining to a criminal offence, an explanation as to why one 
version is being relied on over the other should be provided.

and Emergency Preparedness), 2024 FC 902

17 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 SCR 653 [Vavilov]  
wherein the SCC further affirmed at para. 85 that a reasonable decision is “one that is based on an 
internally coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that 
constrain the decision maker”.

Whether to consider personal circumstances for permanent residents and protected 
persons   
As confirmed by the courts18, MDs are not obligated to consider personal circumstances during 
the A44 process. However, the courts have also affirmed that MDs retain the discretion to 
consider these circumstances, and if they exercise their discretion to do so, the decision must 
be reasonable. The discretion is tempered by their limited role at A44.19 The guidance in this 
section is intended to assist MDs determine when and how to exercise such discretion. 
 
MDs must always keep in mind the principles set out in section 8.2 and 15.1 above when 
rendering decisions under A44, including Parliament’s intention in drafting the IRPA to make 
security of Canadians a top priority.  
 
In consideration of the various objectives of the IRPA and the limited discretion at A44 as 
confirmed by the courts, the CBSA’s policy is that MDs must consider the factors below when 
deciding whether or not to exercise their limited discretion to consider evidence or submissions 
filed by the person concerned regarding personal circumstances.  
Generally speaking, the following factors would weigh against consideration of personal 
circumstances by the MD: 
 
the inadmissibility falls under section A34, A35, A35.1 or A37;   
 
 
A36(1) serious criminality cases in the following circumstances: 
o the permanent resident or protected person was previously issued a 
warning letter by CBSA or had a previous removal order stayed or 
quashed by the IAD on humanitarian and compassionate grounds; 
o the reportable offence:  involved violence that resulted in bodily or 
psychological harm to another person, the use of a firearm or is a sexual 
offence; was committed against a vulnerable person (e.g. minor child or 
intellectually or physically challenged persons, or senior citizen), was a 
racially motivated crime, a crime of gender-based violence, including 
domestic violence, a hate crime or a crime involving trafficking or 
smuggling in large quantities of a controlled substance or weapons;  
o the criminal record of the permanent resident or protected person 
demonstrates a pattern of escalating seriousness 
 
If the decision is not to consider personal circumstances, the MD should state this in their 
A44(2) decision. For example, the MD may state in their decision: “I am not exercising my 
discretion to consider evidence and/or submissions filed on behalf of (name of person 
concerned) pertaining to their personal circumstances given the seriousness of the reportable 
offence”.

If the MD exercises discretion to consider personal circumstances 
If the MD decides to consider the personal circumstances of the person concerned, the CBSA’s 
policy is that the MD must balance these with the objectives of the IRPA to protect public health 
and safety, and maintain the security of Canadian society by denying access to Canadian 
territory to persons who are criminals or security risks.  
Examples of personal circumstances the MD may consider, if they decide to exercise their 
discretion to do so:  
• 
Age at time of landing—Has the person been a permanent resident of Canada since 
childhood?  
• 
Was the permanent resident an adult at the time of admission to Canada? 
• 
Was the person granted protected person status in Canada? 
• 
Length of residence—How long has the person resided in Canada after the date of 
admission?  
• 
Location of family support and responsibilities—Are family members in Canada 
emotionally or financially dependent on the permanent resident? Are all extended family 
members in Canada?  
• 
Degree of establishment—Is the permanent resident financially self-supporting? Are they 
employed? Do they have a marketable trade or skill? Has the permanent resident made 
efforts to establish themselves in Canada through language training or skills upgrading? Is 
there any evidence of community involvement? Has the permanent resident received social 
assistance (frequency/duration)? 
• 
Criminality—Has the permanent resident been convicted of any prior criminal offence? 
Based on reliable information, is the permanent resident involved in criminal or organized 
crime activities? What is the nature and frequency of the person’s interactions with the law? 
(for further details please refer to ENF 5 Writing 44(1) reports, section 10.1, ‘A44(1) reports 
for criminality cases’). 
• 
What is the potential for rehabilitation? How much time has passed since the last 
conviction? Has the permanent resident already been released? For how long? Has the 
permanent resident accepted culpability, expressed remorse, enrolled in or completed 
educational, skills upgrading or rehabilitation programs (for example, Alcoholics 
Anonymous, Narconon/narcotics rehabilitation programs, anger management programs, life 
skills)? Are family members willing and able to support/assist?  
• 
History of non-compliance and current attitude—Has the permanent resident been 
cooperative and forthcoming with information? Has a warning letter been previously issued? 
Does the permanent resident accept responsibility for their actions? Are they remorseful? 
• 
Best interests of any children directly affected by the decision.  
• 
Right of Appeal—Does the person have a right of appeal to the IAD under A63 if a 
removal order is issued? (see section 20.1 of this chapter, ‘Appeals to the Immigration 
Appeal Division’). 
Regardless of the factors being considered, the MD should be aware that there are limitations to 
the scope of their assessment. For example, the Federal Court has made findings to support the 
principle that officials carrying out A44(1) and (2) assessments are not obliged to speculate 
about how and when future deportation might take place, nor is the expectation that a person’s 
rehabilitation be analyzed in considerable detail.

2025-02-20 
15.3 Loss of appeal right cases 
For inadmissibility under A36(1)(a) for permanent residents, it is important for reporting officers 
to obtain the most accurate evidence of the sentence imposed during the A44(1) process in 
order to determine whether the person retains a right of appeal. Under A64, a loss of appeal 
rights for serious criminality under A36(1)(a) must be with respect to a crime that was punished 
in Canada by a term of imprisonment of at least six months.  Where it is not clear from the 
evidence whether the sentence meets the six month threshold under A64(2), before making any 
assessment under A44(1), the officer should obtain evidence demonstrating how the judge 
calculated the total sentence imposed as reflected in the court documents, taking into account 
the imposition of further credits for time served. Regardless of what assessment is made by the 
reporting officer, and especially in cases where the right of appeal is in doubt, the officer and/or 
the MD should clearly articulate in the recommendation and/or decision that the determination 
as to whether the person concerned retains a right of appeal ultimately rests with the IAD. 
15.4 Preparation of warning letter 
Where the MD finds that the A44(1) report is well-founded, but that there are other compelling 
reasons, taking into account the objectives of the IRPA, not to refer the A44(1) report to the ID 
for an admissibility hearing, the MD may exercise their discretion to issue a warning letter. In 
such a case, the decision to issue a warning letter constitutes a disposition of the A44(2) 
proceedings on the existing A44(1) report.   
Based on the limited scope of discretion of the MD, this option to the MD is intended only to be 
available in cases of permanent residents and, in some circumstances, protected persons who 
remain foreign nationals. Such discretion should not be exercised lightly by the MD and must 
take into account all of the circumstances of the case, the limited scope of discretion of the MD, 
the objectives of the IRPA and Agency priorities regarding inadmissibility under A34, A35, 
A35.1, A36(1) and A37.   
In addition to the list of factors provided in section 15.2, in cases involving inadmissibility under 
A36(1), MDs should closely examine the nature of the criminal offence when reviewing the 
A44(1) report before issuing a warning letter. 
While balancing IRPA objectives regarding public safety and security, the MD may also 
consider, in cases where the person is a protected person, whether the severity of the acts 
committed is such that the CBSA officer will be seeking a Danger Opinion under A115.    
The purpose of a warning letter is twofold: it conveys the decision and it is intended to act as a 
deterrent. 
A warning letter sometimes has a third critical role: if, at some point in the future, the person 
becomes reportable again (i.e., new circumstances of inadmissibility arise following the 
issuance of the warning letter), the record of the warning letter will be an important factor to 
consider in an officer’s determination of whether to write a new A44(1) report and/or in the MD’s 
decision to issue a removal order or refer the new report to the ID, should the person engage in 
further unlawful conduct. Officers also rely on the warning letter to demonstrate to the IAD that 
the person concerned was duly cautioned as to the negative repercussions if another violation 
occurred.  
It should be noted, however, that following the issuance of a warning letter, any new A44(1) 
report must be based on new facts/circumstances. In other words, a new report for the same 
allegation must not arise solely based on the same facts underlying the allegation of the 
previous report on which the warning letter was issued and the MD cannot re-open the previous 


===== PAGE 48 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) 
48 
2025-02-20 
A44(2) proceedings. For example, if a permanent resident receives a warning letter based on an 
A44(1) report for A36(1)(a) (e.g., based on a robbery conviction), the permanent resident cannot 
be re-reported under A44(1) for A36(1)(a) and/or referred for admissibility hearing based on the 
same conviction should the permanent resident be subsequently convicted of a non-reportable 
offence (e.g., theft under).  
 
The warning letter should always be printed on letterhead. The fields should never be 
handwritten. This cannot be a standard form letter, as it needs to be tailored to the individual 
circumstances of the person concerned.  
 
Every effort should be made to hand-deliver the warning letter. The person concerned 
should be asked to sign the file copy acknowledging receipt of the original. This is especially 
important in criminal cases in the event of a subsequent violation.  
 
If the letter cannot be hand-delivered because the person concerned is outside of the local 
office’s jurisdiction, the letter should be forwarded to the responsible office with a request to 
hand-deliver the letter. If this is not feasible or practical, the letter should be sent by 
registered mail. 
 
Once the letter is completed and signed, it must be uploaded into GCMS and the MD  
disposition under the A44(2) examination process must be updated accordingly. The MD is 
also required to enter detailed examination or application notes into GCMS fully supporting 
the decision being made (see section 22, ‘Entering MD decisions into GCMS’). The 
issuance of the warning letter must also be recorded in the National Case Management 
System (NCMS) in offices where NCMS is utilized. 
For an example of the warning letter, see Appendix B: Sample warning letter. 
 
 
16 Adjourning Proceedings 
 
Circumstances may warrant the adjournment of a proceeding under A44(2). In some cases, the 
MD may have to consider a request for an adjournment to ensure that a person has a 
reasonable opportunity to provide more evidence or to obtain counsel. 
 
The MD may also have to adjourn proceedings based on operational reasons, such as the lack 
of an interpreter, however adjournments should not be a tool of administrative convenience. 
 
In all cases, the MD will need to ensure that any decision regarding a request to adjourn is 
reasonable and meets the procedural fairness requirements set out in previous sections. 
 
 
17 Procedure: Entry for the purpose of further examination or an 
admissibility hearing (Port of entry officers) 
 
Under A23, an officer may authorize a person to enter Canada for the purpose of further 
examination or an admissibility hearing. It is important to note that, pursuant to R43(2), a foreign 
national authorized to enter Canada under A23 does not, by reason of that authorization, 
become a temporary resident or a permanent resident. The MD may have to initiate entry under 
A23 following an adjournment of the A44(2) proceeding or for operational reasons, such as the 
lack of an interpreter, however this procedure should not be used as a tool of administrative 
convenience. 


===== PAGE 49 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) 
49 
2025-02-20 
The MD should not consider a request for entry under A23 to provide additional information 
unless all of the following conditions have been met: 
 
 
there are strong indications that the person can easily produce additional documents 
relevant to the inadmissibility report determination; 
 
the MD believes the person’s indications to be credible; and 
 
the person has not yet been given a reasonable chance to present additional 
documents. 
MDs should be cautious when considering entry for the purpose of an admissibility hearing 
since the ID may not schedule an admissibility hearing for weeks or months, which could lead to 
the foreign national remaining in Canada for a prolonged period without any legal status or a 
means of financial support. MDs may also consider other options such as directing persons 
back to the United States under R41 (see section 19, ‘Procedure: Directing persons back to the 
United States under R41’). 
 
Note:  Pursuant to R43(1) the imposition of certain prescribed conditions for persons authorized 
to enter Canada under A23 is mandatory.   
 
The MD should also keep in mind the provisions of A44(3), A55(3) and A56, which provide 
authority to detain and release persons, and impose further conditions—including the payment 
of a deposit or the posting of a guarantee—following the furthering of an examination of a 
person who is the subject of an A44(1) report. For further guidance see ENF 8 Deposits and 
Guarantees. For further details regarding detention and release authorities, see ENF 20 
Detention and ENF 34 Alternatives to detention. 
 
 
18 Imposition of Conditions following the A44(1) report for A34:  
Mandatory circumstances 
 
A44(3) authorizes officers to impose any conditions, including the posting of a deposit or the 
posting of a guarantee for compliance with conditions, that the officer considers necessary, on a 
permanent resident or foreign national who is the subject of a subsection A44(1) report, an 
admissibility hearing or, being in Canada, a removal order.   
 
Whenever officers write an A44(1) report, consideration should be given to imposing conditions 
on the foreign national or permanent resident. The MD also has the authority to impose 
conditions during the A44(2) process (e.g., following an adjournment of the proceedings or 
following the decision to issue a removal order or refer the A44(1) report to the ID for an 
admissibility hearing). Officers and MDs should always consult the D & D instruments regarding  
the authority to impose conditions as this authority may vary depending on whether the person 
concerned is a foreign national or a permanent resident.  
 
The MD must be aware that in cases of inadmissibility on security grounds under A34, the 
imposition of conditions is mandatory once the report has been referred to the ID. Under the 
IRPA, decision-makers specified in the relevant legislative authority are required to impose the 
baseline prescribed conditions in prescribed circumstances: CBSA officers are required in 
A44(4) and A56(3); ID is required in A58(5); Minister is required in A58.1(4) and A77.1(1); 
Federal Court is required in A82(6). 


===== PAGE 50 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) 
50 
2025-02-20 
The prescribed conditions must be imposed in the following circumstances: 
 
 
when an inadmissibility report on grounds of security (A34) is referred to the ID and the 
subject of the report is not detained (designated CBSA officers); 
 
when the subject of either an inadmissibility report on grounds of security (A34) that has 
been referred to the ID or a removal order for inadmissibility on grounds of security is 
released from detention; [designated CBSA officers under A56(3); ID under A58(5) and 
the Minister under A58.1(4)]. 
 
For each of the circumstances outlined above, the prescribed conditions to be imposed are 
found in R250.1. 
 
See Acknowledgement of Conditions for IRPA Section 34 Cases [BSF798]. 
 
 
19 Procedure:  Directing persons back to the United States under R41 
 
R41 authorizes an officer to direct a foreign national seeking to enter Canada from the United 
States (U.S.) to return to the U.S. if: 
 
 
no officer is able to complete an examination [R41(a)]; 
 
the MD is not available to consider, under A44(2), a report made with respect to the 
person [R41(b)];  
 
an admissibility hearing cannot be held by the ID [R41(c)]; or 
 
the foreign national is prohibited from entering Canada by an order or regulation made 
by the Governor in Council under the Emergencies Act or the Quarantine Act. 
In such cases, the person concerned may be given a Direction to Return to the United States 
form (BSF505) in appropriate circumstances. Officers and MDs should be aware that there is a 
specific policy for refugee claimants at the land port of entry. 
 
A person who has been directed to return to the U.S. pending an admissibility hearing by the ID 
and who seeks to come into Canada for reasons other than to appear at that hearing is 
considered to be seeking entry. If such a person remains inadmissible for the same reason(s), 
and if a member of the ID is not reasonably available, the person may be directed again to 
return to the U.S. to wait until a member of the ID is available. In these circumstances it is not 
necessary to write a new A44(1) report. 
 
Note: Generally, persons directed back to the U.S. who choose not to return to Canada will not 
be subject to enforcement action, as they have no desire to continue with their application to 
enter Canada. Such persons will simply be deemed to have withdrawn their application. Officers 
should therefore not counsel the person that failure to return in these instances will 
automatically result in enforcement action while the person is not in Canada. 
 
In exceptional cases, it may be appropriate to pursue enforcement action for persons seeking 
entry who have failed to comply with R44(3). Officers and MDs should consider all information 
and individual circumstances of each case before they elect to proceed with enforcement action

under A44(1)/ A44(2), including the circumstances surrounding the failure to comply and the 
intent of the person concerned.

20 Appeals and Judicial Review— Removal Order 
 
There are two levels of review of decisions made under the IRPA. Sponsors, permanent 
resident visa holders, permanent residents and protected persons have a statutory right to 
appeal adverse decisions to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the Immigration and 
Refugee Board. In all other cases, where no statutory right of appeal exists under the IRPA or 
those rights have been exhausted, there is a right to seek judicial review at the Federal Court of 
Canada. 
20.1 Appeals to the Immigration Appeal Division  
 
The MD will encounter three circumstances in which a person against whom they have made a 
removal order may have a right of appeal to the IAD. Those circumstances involve a person 
who is: 
 
 
a foreign national who holds a permanent resident visa; 
 
a permanent resident (inside or outside Canada); and 
 
a protected person. 
 
Where a person has a right to appeal, removal orders are stayed until the end of the appeal 
period expires (30 days) if no appeal is made and until the day of final determination of the 
appeal, if an appeal is made. Pursuant to A50(c), if the IAD grants a stay of removal, the  
removal order is stayed under A66(b) and A68 until the stay is no longer in force.

*A64(1)— No Right to Appeal  
 
No appeal may be made to the IAD by a foreign national or their sponsor or by a permanent 
resident or protected person if they have been found to be inadmissible on grounds of: 
 
 
security, violating human or international rights (A34)  
 
violating human or international rights (A35)   
 
sanctions (A35.1) 
 
serious criminality (A36)**  
 
organized criminality (A37)  
 
**must be with respect to a crime that was punished in Canada by        
             a term of imprisonment of at least six months or that is described in paragraph 36(1)(b)  
             or (c) 
 
When the MD makes a removal order against a person who may have a right to appeal that 
decision to the IAD, officers must advise the persons of that right. This is easily accomplished 
by giving them a notification of appeal form and informing them of their right to appeal. 
 
The MD is also to provide the persons with the address and telephone number of the IAD 
registry office so that the persons may file a notice of appeal with the Registrar if they so 
choose. 
 
The MD should also obtain a written acknowledgement from the persons that they have been 
advised of their right to appeal to the IAD and place it in the case file. 
 
See Appendix G:  Sample letter—  IAD Appeal Acknowledgement Letter 
20.2 Right to file an application for leave and judicial review— Where no statutory 
right of appeal exists 
 
When an MD makes a removal order against a person who does not have the right to appeal to 
the IAD, the MD is to advise the person of their right to file an application for leave and judicial 
review with the Federal Court pursuant to A72(1). 
 
For example, foreign nationals who are not protected persons or who do not hold a permanent 
resident visa have no statutory right of appeal to the IAD against a removal order issued by the 
MD. However, they may challenge a removal order made by the MD at the Federal Court. 
 
If a statutory appeal, as may be provided for by the IRPA, has not been resolved, neither the 
Minister nor the person concerned may appeal to the Federal Court.  
 
The MD should obtain a written acknowledgment from the persons concerned, stating that they 
have been advised of their right to file an application for leave and judicial review, and place it in 
the case file. Applications for leave and judicial review must be filed within 15 days of the date of 
the removal order. 
 
See Appendix H:  Sample letter—  Judicial Review Acknowledgement Letter

Removals.  
 
 
21 Multiple allegations  
 
Where the person is inadmissible under multiple provisions of the IRPA, it is generally 
recommended that the officer writes a separate report for each allegation. The MD will then 
make a determination on each report during the A44(2) process.  
 
There may be instances where multiple allegations are contained within the same report. This 
practice is generally discouraged, especially where the jurisdiction for each inadmissibility does 
not lie with the same decision-maker (i.e., MD or ID). It should be noted, however, that where a 
report contains one or more inadmissibility allegation, and if the MD has jurisdiction for all 
inadmissibility allegations contained within that report, the MD can determine the disposition of 
that report; conversely, where there are several inadmissibility allegations in a report and the 
MD has jurisdiction for only some of them, the MD is not authorized to determine a disposition 
for that report, and all allegations must be referred to the ID. 
 
In cases where multiple A44(1) reports have been prepared against an individual concurrently 
and the MD is of the opinion that each of the inadmissibility allegations is well-founded, the MD 
should consider the potential consequences of not referring all reports for an admissibility 
hearing (where the jurisdiction to the issue the removal order rests with the ID) at the same 
time, including the following: 
 
in cases where multiple reports have been written for A36(1)(a) serious criminality based 
on separate convictions in Canada, the fact that having a separate removal order on 
each report may be critical in ensuring that IRPA objectives are met in the event that one 
or more of the underlining convictions and/or sentences are later overturned on appeal 
by the criminal courts; 
 
abuse of process arguments may be raised at a later time if all A44(1) reports before the 
MD are not referred for an admissibility hearing at the same time.   
 
 
22 Entering MD decisions into GCMS 
 
When processing or issuing an immigration document, completing an MD review, or conducting 
an examination, the MD is required to enter detailed examination or application notes into 
GCMS fully supporting the decision being made, regardless of whether the decision was 
positive or negative. 
 
 
Notes are to be factual and should not contain personal opinions which are not 
supported by elements collected during the examination or review. The notes may 
consist of such items as: questions and answers asked during the examination or 
review, admissibility concerns the officer or MD may have, a synopsis of any 
documentation reviewed or requested, and any other pertinent details related to the 
examination/application or MD review. The notes are to include the decision made and 
rationale supporting the decision. Notes should provide sufficient detail to allow another 
GCMS user to understand what transpired and why an action was taken. Notes entered

2025-02-20 
on the Client screen should be general information on the client, and should not be used 
for Examination/Application Notes. 
 
Officers are to continue to record user remarks on facilitation documents and narratives 
in the inadmissibility sub-tab supporting the inadmissibility allegations. 
 
MDs should be uploading examination notes that clearly show that procedural fairness 
has been met, and what factors were considered as part of the decision. 
 
It is important to note that A44(2) decision notes in GCMS are also reviewed by officials 
processing applications, and therefore may directly impact future decisions (e.g. 
applications for TRPs, temporary residence or permanent residence).  
 
CBSA officers may consult the GCMS Help Centre for additional information on how to enter 
notes and upload documents into GCMS. 
 
 
 
23 Key aspects of assessing inadmissibility under A36 
 
23.1 Criminal equivalency between foreign and Canadian jurisdictions 
 
As part of the inadmissibility determination for A36(1)(b) or (c) and A36(2)(b) or (c) as well as 
considerations related to criminal rehabilitation under the IRPA, it is necessary for the MD to 
determine if a conviction or offence committed outside of Canada has an equivalent in Canadian 
law. This means that in A44(2) proceedings, all necessary evidence for determining criminal 
equivalency will also need to accompany the A44(1) report.   
In other words, the MD must have the evidence required to determine whether the acts 
committed abroad and punished there would be punishable in Canada. This analysis is a 
necessary part of the MD’s decision in order to refer the report to the ID for an admissibility 
hearing, even though the MD does not have jurisdiction to issue the removal order. 
It is important to note that A36(1)(b) or (c) and A36(2)(b) or (c) cannot be used where the 
person has been acquitted or a court has made a finding of not guilty. 
For further details, see ENF 2 Evaluating Inadmissibility and ENF 3 Admissibility Hearings and 
Detention Reviews. 
23.2 Record suspensions for convictions in Canada 
 
MDs must also be careful not to rely on convictions for which a record suspension has been 
granted as evidence of a criminal record. 
 
In the case of convictions in Canada, the Parole Board of Canada has the authority to grant and 
issue record suspensions (formerly known as “pardons”) to persons described in A36(1)(a), and 
A36(2)(a), who have been convicted in Canada of an offence under an Act of Parliament. 
 
Record suspension for in-Canada offences is the responsibility of the Parole Board of Canada, 
so neither deemed rehabilitation nor rehabilitation can be granted for such offences. 
 
For more information about record suspensions, see ENF2, Evaluating inadmissibility.

2025-02-20 
23.3 Criminal Rehabilitation 
 
Pursuant to A36(3)(c), in prescribed circumstances, an inadmissibility under A36(2)(b) or (c) 
may be overcome through rehabilitation.  
 
There are two types of Rehabilitation: Deemed Rehabilitation and Individual Rehabilitation. The 
effect of both is that they remove specific grounds of inadmissibility if certain conditions exist or 
prescribed requirements are met. 
 
Under the D&D instruments, only certain MDs have been delegated to assess and render a 
decision on applications for individual rehabilitation. 
 
For further guidance on criminal rehabilitation, see ENF2 Evaluating inadmissibility. 
23.4 Offences under the Youth Criminal Justice Act 
 
A36(3)(e) exempts permanent residents and foreign nationals found guilty under the Young 
Offenders Act (YOA) or the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA) from the inadmissibility 
provisions in A36(1) and A36(2). 
 
Canadian legislation (YOA and YCJA) defines a young offender/young person as someone who 
is at least 12, but under 18 years of age. A child under the age of 12, cannot be charged with an 
offence under the Criminal Code of Canada and a person 18 years old and over would be 
charged as an adult. 
 
The MD must ensure that they do not rely on or refer to youth offences in any determinations 
under A44(2), except where access is authorized under the YCJA.  Information that is not 
accessible under the provisions of the YCJA cannot be considered and must not be included or 
referenced at any point during A44(1) or (2) proceedings. Moreover, contravention of the 
provisions of the YCJA is a serious matter. 
 
The importance of verifying whether information is protected by YCJA provisions was 
highlighted in Abdi v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) 2017 FC 950. In 
that case, the Federal Court held that while the MD did not commit an error in relying on youth 
crimes that the applicant was found guilty of where access to these records was not restricted 
by virtue of section 119(9) of the YCJA, the MD’s reliance on youth offences that were 
withdrawn or dismissed was unreasonable since section 119(2)(c) of the YCJA allows access to 
these records for only a brief period after dismissal or withdrawal of the youth charges and the 
access period to such charges had expired. 
 
Officials conducting A44(1) and A44(2) functions must ensure that they only rely on youth 
records to which access is not restricted under the provisions of the YCJA.  It is therefore 
important for reporting officers and the MD to be aware of the provisions of the YCJA which 
relate to access to youth records.

Dear XXXX; 
 
This letter is in reference to your criminal conviction(s) and status in Canada.  Enclosed, you will find a 
report written under subsection 44(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. 
 
Permanent residents of Canada may be reported to the Minister when they have engaged in criminal 
activity of a serious nature. Your conviction for xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx is reportable under paragraph 
36(1)(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. 
 
This report is now a permanent part of your immigration record.  The circumstances of your case have 
been considered carefully and it has been decided that your case will not be referred to the Immigration 
Division for an admissibility hearing at this time. 
 
You must understand however, that this decision may be reviewed in the future should new adverse 
information come to our attention or any further criminal convictions be registered against you. If such a 
review occurs, a decision to pursue enforcement action may result in referring you to the Immigration 
Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board for an admissibility hearing.  The outcome of this hearing 
could result in a deportation order and your permanent removal from Canada. 
 
We trust that you understand the gravity of this matter and that we will not be required to contact you 
again as the result of any further criminal activity. 
 
 
Yours truly, 
 
 
 
(signature) 
 
Name of Minister’s Delegate and title

2025-02-20 
Appendix C:  Steps for in-person A44(2) proceeding where MD has jurisdiction to 
issue a removal order 
 
Prior to the A44(2) proceedings, MDs should review A44(1) report and accompanying evidence 
to ensure: 
 
person concerned is not a Canadian citizen 
 
person is not a Permanent Resident of Canada (except for residency obligation files) 
 
person concerned is not an Indian registered under the Indian Act 
 
person’s biographical data is correctly cited (name(s), date of birth) 
 
status of person concerned is correctly identified in A44(1) report 
 
 
inadmissibility section has been properly cited 
 
A44(1) report has been signed and dated 
 
ensure MD has jurisdiction to issue the removal order under R228 
 
 
During the A44(2) proceedings, MD should: 
 
Step 1  Notate the date/time of proceedings 
 
Introduce themselves as the MD  
 
 
Step 2  Confirm person before the MD is the subject of the A44(1) report  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 3  Determine whether person concerned requires an accredited interpreter 
 
Where an interpreter is required, confirm person understands the interpreter  
            and that MD may continue with the proceedings. Advise the person that they      
            should advise MD at any time if they do not understand the interpreter. 
 
If necessary, adjourn proceedings to obtain interpreter. 
 
 
 
Step 4  Confirm person concerned has a copy of the report and the evidence being used to   
             support the allegation and has had the opportunity to review it.  
 
Read the allegations contained in the A44(1) to the person concerned. 
 
State the purpose of the proceedings and refer to the A44(1) report. 
 
Advise the person that they must answer questions completely and truthfully. 
 
Step 5  Explain the process MD will be following, evidence to be considered and the  
             consequences of finding the report well-founded. Ensure the person concerned    
             understands that this process may result in a removal order being issued, the type of     
             removal order, and the consequence of this order. 
 
Step 6  In detained cases:  Prior to commencing the proceeding, advise the person concerned  
            of their right to have a counsel of their choosing present at their own expense. This right  
            applies in all cases where a person is detained under an Act of Parliament and includes  
            situations where the person is detained by the criminal courts while facing charges or  
            serving a sentence and subject to IRPA proceedings. Should the person express an  
            intention to communicate with counsel, the MD should adjourn the proceeding and allow  
            a reasonable period of time for the person to retain counsel. 
 
In released cases:  The person does not have the right to have counsel present during 
the MD review, however the MD should consider permitting counsel’s attendance should 


===== PAGE 61 =====
ENF 6  Review of reports under subsection 44(2) 
61 
2025-02-20 
the person concerned have a counsel present, as long as counsel’s presence will not 
interfere with the process. MDs are not obligated to postpone MD review proceedings 
due to counsel unavailability, however, may consider such requests on case-by-case 
basis.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Step 7  Verify each of the case elements of the allegation contained in the A44(1) report  
 
 by questioning the person to confirm that each of these elements has been proven     
             by the evidence, either verbally or in writing.   
 
 Verify person concerned has no other evidence/information to provide and if so,  
determine whether an adjournment is warranted.  
 
Allow the person the opportunity to respond and acknowledge their evidence and 
document this either by notes or making copies of what is presented, particularly if there 
is any inconsistency between the allegation in the A44(1) report and the person's 
declaration. MD must ensure that all the evidence presented has been considered. 
 
Step 8  The MD should ask the person how long they intend to remain in Canada and follow  
             the steps in ENF 6, section 13, ‘Procedure: Handling possible claims for refugee  
             protection’. 
 
Where the person does not express a fear of returning to their country or indicate an 
intention to make a claim, the MD should proceed with the decision and issue a removal 
order, if appropriate. 
 
Where the person’s statements indicate a fear of returning to the country that may relate 
to refugee protection, the MD is to inform the person of the definition of a “Convention 
refugee” or “person in need of protection” as found in A96 and A97, and ask whether 
they wish to make a claim before proceeding with the issuance of a removal order. 
 
Step 9   Advise the person of the decision and the reasons for the decision.  
 
 
Step 10   If issuing a removal order, provide the person concerned with a copy of the removal  
                order and  its legal effect.   
 
Where applicable, explain the Certificate of Departure process and that a Departure 
Order will turn into a Deportation Order should they fail to properly follow the process for 
verifying departure (for further information, see ENF 10 Removals). 
 
Advise person concerned of their right to appeal (as applicable) or right to seek judicial 
review and the relevant time limits and document this. Provide relevant appeal forms 
and have the person sign the relevant acknowledgement letter, where appropriate. For 
further information, see ENF 6, section 20 ‘Appeals and Judicial Review- Removal 
Order’. 
   
Step 11  At the conclusion of the review, notate the time and sign the record of decision, 
               including the completion of the MD portion of forms [e.g., BSF516, IMM5084 or  
               A44(1) narrative report]. Complete appropriate system updates/data entry.
