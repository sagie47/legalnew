The Minister of \nCitizenship and Immigration [also known as Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada \n(IRCC)] and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (PS) are jointly \nresponsible for the administration and enforcement of the IRPA, however there are some \ndifferences. The IRCC Minister is responsible for the overall administration of the IRPA, unless \notherwise specified. The Minister of PS has the primary responsibility for the administration of \nthe IRPA as it relates to the following:  \n \n \nport of entry examinations; \n \npolicy lead relating to enforcement of the IRPA including arrest, detention and \nremoval; \n \nestablishment of policies respecting the enforcement of the IRPA and \ninadmissibility under A34/A35/A35.1/A36(2.1)/A37; and \n \ndeclarations referred to under A42.1 (Ministerial Relief provision) \n \nPursuant to A6(1), the responsible Minister has the authority to designate specific persons or \nclasses of persons to carry out any purpose of any provision of the IRPA with respect to their \nindividual mandate as described in A4, and to specify the powers and duties of the officers so \ndesignated. This is referred to as the designation of authority. In addition, A6(2) authorizes \nthat anything that may be done by the Minister under the Act may be done by a person that the \nMinister authorizes in writing. This is referred to as delegation of authority.   \n \nEach Minister who has responsibilities under the IRPA has written an instrument of delegation \nand designation that is periodically updated. The Delegation of Authority and Designations of \nOfficers (D & D) instruments stipulate who has the authority to perform specific immigration-\nrelated functions. CBSA and IRCC personnel are designated by position to perform all \ndelegated or designated authorities, including those associated with A44(1)/A44(2) functions. It \nis to be noted that the IRPA D & D instruments have a hierarchical link which means only the \nlowest level of authority is included in the D & D instruments as every position above this one \n(with a direct hierarchical link) has the same authority to perform specific immigration-related \nfunctions. \n \n"

It is important to note that while IRCC officers \nhave been designated the authority to write reports for most inadmissibility sections, A44(1) \nreports for inadmissibility under A34 (security grounds), A35 (grounds of violating human or \ninternational rights), A35.1 (sanctions) and A37 (grounds of organized criminality) may only be \nprepared and reviewed by CBSA.  \n \nAll reports written by CBSA or IRCC officers will be reviewed by the Minister’s Delegate (MD) \nwho has been delegated the authority under the D & D instruments. If the MD is of the opinion \nthat the report is well-founded, the MD will make the appropriate decision based on the \nevidence and determine whether to:  \n \n \nissue a removal order, if the allegation is within the MD’s authority pursuant to \nR228); or  \n \nrefer the report to the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board  \n(IRB) pursuant to R229. \n \nFor additional information see Appendix F:  Table: Immigration and Refugee Protection Act \n(IRPA) Inadmissible Classes  \n \nNote:  Policy requires that even where officers and officials acting in the capacity of the \nMinister’s Delegate (including chiefs and directors) have the delegated authority under \nthe D & D instruments, they should not perform Minister's Delegate functions and \nreviews until they have successfully completed the necessary training to perform the \nA44(2) function.  This policy is consistent with the Federal Court’s decision in Zhang v. Canada \n(Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 362 where judicial review was granted based on a \nfinding that there was an inadequate record before the court to conclude that the MD had \nreceived the required Minister’s Delegate Review training and was therefore authorized to issue \na removal order.   \n \n \n5 Definitions \n \nAdult legally responsible \nAn adult legally responsible for a minor or suspected incompetent person may be their parent or \nlegal guardian. If the accompanying adult is not a parent or guardian, reasonable efforts must \nbe made to contact a parent or guardian.

The Federal Court has found that the content of the duty of \nfairness in A44 proceedings will vary depending on the nature and circumstances of the \ndecision being made. For example, in Awed v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2006 FC \n469, the Court found that where an officer calls a permanent resident or foreign national for an \ninterview in order to confirm facts that would support an A44(1) opinion and report, the content \nof the duty of fairness at the initial stage is minimal. The Court found, however, that such a \ndegree of fairness requires that the officer advise the person of the purpose of the interview so \nthat the person is put on notice of the possible consequences and has an opportunity to make \nmeaningful submissions. In Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. \nCha, 2006 FCA 126, the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) found that it was open to the Federal \nCourt judge to find that the officer had breached the duty of fairness in failing to inform the \napplicant of the possible consequences of the initial A44(1) interview, however the FCA \ndisagreed with the Federal Court’s conclusion that section A44 determinations call for a \nrelatively high degree of participatory rights in respect of persons who are inadmissible on \ngrounds of serious or simple criminality in Canada, as officers and MDs are simply on a fact-\nfinding mission at the A44 stage.  \n \nIt is important for officers to differentiate those cases where the MD may issue a removal order \nand those cases where the jurisdiction to issue a removal order lies with the ID, as different \nprocedural requirements and considerations will apply in order to ensure that procedural \nfairness and natural justice are met.  \n \nThe spectrum of procedural fairness will also depend on the status of the person concerned and \nadditional considerations will apply for permanent residents and protected persons (See section \n8, ‘Considerations before writing an A44(1) Report- Scope of officer discretion’; section 9.2, \n‘Special considerations for protected persons’; section 10, ‘A44(1) reports concerning \npermanent residents of Canada’). \n  \n6.2 Procedures for persons less than 18 years old or persons unable to \nappreciate the nature of the proceedings \n \nR228(4) provides for specific safeguards for certain vulnerable persons by requiring that where \nthe person: \n \n \nis under 18 years of age and not accompanied by a parent or an adult legally \nresponsible for them;  or  \n \nis unable, in the opinion of the Minister, to appreciate the nature of the proceedings and \nis not accompanied by a parent or an adult legally responsible for them \n \nthe matter must be referred to the ID for an admissibility hearing.  In these cases, the MD does \nnot have jurisdiction to issue a removal order.   \n \nSuch cases will call for a higher degree of procedural fairness at the A44 stage and officers \nmust take extra care to ensure that the person’s interests are represented and that the evidence \nhas been fully and fairly considered. \n \nDuring the ID proceedings, a designated representative will be appointed pursuant to A167(2) to \nrepresent the person’s interests and ensure that procedural fairness requirements are met with \n"

In these hearings, parties will also be \ngoverned by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Chairperson Guideline 8: \n‘Procedures With Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB’ \n \nWhere a person appears to be unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings, it is \nimportant for officers to identify this as soon as possible during the A44(1) process. Where an \nofficer, in the course of their interactions with a person, has identified that a person has a \nsuspected or known mental illness and does not appreciate the nature of the proceedings, this \nshould be clearly documented in notes and flagged for the MD.  \n \nIn such cases, officers should also ensure that other departmental and agency guidelines with \nrespect to dealing with vulnerable persons are followed.  See section 6.6 ‘Dealing with \nvulnerable persons’;  ENF 20 Detention; and ENF 34 Alternatives to Detention. \n \nFor additional guidance, including how to identify a vulnerable person, see IRCC Program \ndelivery instructions on Processing in-Canada claims for refugee protection of minors and \nvulnerable persons. \n \n6.3 Official languages \n \nBoth the Official Languages Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms establish \nthe right of individuals who are subject to administrative proceedings in Canada to communicate \nwith employees of IRCC and CBSA in the official language of their choice, either in French or \nEnglish. Officers carrying out the administration of the IRPA must respect the right of the \nindividual to proceed in French or English. In order to ensure that procedural fairness is \nmaintained, officers should ensure that the Minister’s documents are provided in the language \nof the proceedings and, where necessary, obtain translations (e.g., a certificate of conviction \nfrom another country that is not in French or English that the Minister is relying on as evidence). \n \n6.4 Interpreters \n \nOfficers must be satisfied that the person concerned is able to understand and communicate in \neither of the official languages in which the proceeding is being held. If necessary, an interpreter \nis to be provided to enable the persons to understand and communicate fully.  \n \nNote:  Travellers arriving at a port of entry into Canada do not have an automatic right to an \ninterpreter upon request during routine port of entry examinations, however there are situations \nwhere officers at the port of entry are required to suspend the proceedings until a qualified \ninterpreter is available. This may include circumstances where the officer is considering denying \nentry to the traveller. For further information, see Nere v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), \n2018 FC 672.  \n \nCBSA officers should consult guidelines on the use of interpreters contained in ENF 4 Port of \nentry examinations (section 8.5, ‘Use of interpreters’).  \n \nFor further information, see IRCC Program delivery instructions (PDI) on interpreters. \n \n \n \n"

In all detained cases, persons must be given the opportunity to obtain and instruct \ncounsel at their own expense. Counsel includes a barrister, solicitor, family member, consultant \nor friend. \n \nIn detained cases, officers must inform persons of their right to counsel prior to commencing the \ninterview. This right applies in all cases (port of entry or inland) where a person is detained \nunder an Act of Parliament and includes situations where the person is detained by the criminal \ncourts while facing charges or serving a sentence and interviewed for IRPA purposes. \n \nPort of entry:  Generally, CBSA’s policy is not to permit counsel at a port of entry examinations \nunless arrest/detention has occurred. However, if an officer is dealing with an individual who \ndoes have counsel present, the officer should allow the counsel to remain present as long as \ncounsel does not interfere with the examination process.  \n \nNote:  In Dehghani v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] 1 S.C.R. \n1053], the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) determined that the principles of fundamental \njustice do not include the right to counsel for routine information-gathering, such as that \ngathered at port of entry examination interviews. The SCC further held that an Immigration \nSecondary examination at a port of entry does not constitute a detention within the meaning of \nparagraph 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.2  \n \nFor further information regarding the right to counsel at POE examinations, see ENF 4 Port of \nentry examinations. \n \nIn non-detained inland cases (CBSA/IRCC):  A non-detained person does not have the right \nto have counsel present during A44(1) interviews, however in the spirit of procedural fairness, \nthe officer shall inform the person of the possibility of obtaining counsel prior to commencing the \ninterview. Officers should permit counsel’s participation should the individual subject to the \nA44(1) process have a counsel. Call-in notices for interviews should advise the person that they \nmay have counsel present. \n \nWhere counsel is representing the person concerned at an examination or A44(1) proceeding, \nofficers should ensure that counsel’s identity, the fact of counsel’s presence at the proceeding \nand statements made by counsel on behalf of the person concerned are documented in the \nofficer’s notes, and that counsel’s representations have been considered in their decision. \nOfficers may also need the person’s representative to complete a Use of a Representative form \n(IMM 5476).   \n \nFor further information, see IRCC Program delivery instructions (PDI) on Use of \n                                               \n2 Although the SCC held that secondary examination does not constitute detention, this decision also \nhighlighted that detention within the meaning of section 10(b) of the Charter would result where restraints \non the person’s liberty by state authorities have gone beyond those required for the routine processing or \nscreening of their application to enter Canada. Further, while the SCC’s decision affirmed that delays in \nroutine examinations due to operational necessity do not mean the person is “detained”, officers should \nbe cognizant that unreasonably lengthy delays in the examination could lead to the conclusion that the \nperson is detained within the meaning of section 10(b) of the Charter.  \n \n"

Allowing counsel to participate, if ready to do so, does not \nmean that the officer is required to tolerate disruptive or discourteous behaviour by counsel. \nWhere such conduct is encountered, counsel may be asked to leave and/or the proceeding may \nbe adjourned to another time. In such cases, the officer should ensure to document their \nreasons for taking such action. \n \n6.6 Dealing with vulnerable persons  \n \n6.6.1 Considerations for vulnerable persons in the context of A44 \n \nIt is an overall goal of Canada’s immigration program to treat all persons with dignity and \nrespect. In exercising their IRPA authorities, officials must approach all cases in a \nnonjudgmental manner, remain sensitive to the potential needs and limitations of vulnerable \npersons, and recognize that a person they are dealing with may have experienced some form of \nviolence, abuse or trauma. \n \nIn the context of A44, vulnerable persons may face particular challenges, including an impaired \nability to answer questions/provide information to officials respecting a potential IRPA \ninadmissibility, due to a physical or psychological frailty or for other reasons. Such persons may \ninclude, but would not be limited to: \n \n \nminors (under 18 years of age), including unaccompanied minors;  \n \nelderly persons; \n \nindividuals with severe medical conditions or physical disabilities;  \n \npersons with a suspected or known mental illness; \n \npersons who have suffered traumatic experiences that resulted in some degree of \nvulnerability, including: \no victims3 of gender-based violence (GBV) (see section 6.6.3); \no victims/suspected victims of trafficking in persons (VTIPs) or family violence. \n \nIn the context of A44 procedures, officers should: \n \n \nIdentify vulnerable persons at the earliest opportunity in order to ensure that appropriate  \naccommodations are made and any relevant considerations are factored into decisions \nand actions taken. In some instances, officers will need to use their observational skills, \ndiscretion and sound judgement in identifying a person as vulnerable.   \n \n \nRecognize that a vulnerable individual’s ability to respond to questions or provide \ninformation may be severely impaired, and remain sensitive to the impact of a perceived \nvulnerability during the A44 process, including during interviews. \n \n \nTo the extent possible, prevent vulnerable persons from becoming traumatized or re-\ntraumatized during the A44 process. \n \n                                               \n3 It is important to recognize wherever the term “victim” is used, that some persons who have experienced \nviolence, trauma or abuse may prefer to be referred to as “survivors” rather than “victims”. \n"

These circumstances may manifest themselves as an \nindividual being reluctant to discuss, or having difficulty discussing, their SOGIE with an officer \nbased on a fear or general mistrust of authority figures, particularly where intolerance or \npunishment of individuals with diverse SOGIE are sanctioned by state officials in an individual’s \ncountry of origin. \n \nOfficers need to be sensitive to the possibility that SOGIE issues may exist in any case they \nencounter when executing their IRPA authorities.

This is referred to as gender-based violence (GBV), which is a human rights \nviolation.  \n \nIt is important to note that GBV is not limited to physical violence and can also include \nemotional/psychological abuse, harassment, threats, sexual violence, coercive control, \nhumiliation, financial abuse, discrimination or neglect. It is important to note that these may also \noccur online through “cyberviolence”6.  \n \nOfficers should be aware that certain individuals face a greater risk of experiencing GBV, \nincluding:  women, girls, 2SLGBTQI+ people and people living with disabilities. Moreover, the \nrisk of GBV may be increased with the intersection of any two or more of these characteristics. \nOther groups that may experience high levels of GBV may also include Black women and \nnewcomer women to Canada7.  \n \nIntimate partner violence (IPV), also referred to as domestic violence or spousal violence, is a \nwidespread form of GBV that encompasses multiple forms of harm perpetrated by a current or \nformer intimate partner or spouse. IPV can occur in many types of relationships, including \nbetween married or common-law spouses as well as within dating relationships, regardless of \ngender and sexual orientation and whether or not the partners co-habit. \n \nFor further information respecting IPV, see the Government of Canada’s Fact sheet on Intimate \npartner violence. \n \nDepending on their cultural background, victims of GBV may be reluctant to disclose their \nexperiences in order to not “shame” their families or communities. Similarly, women who have \nbeen subjected to IPV/domestic violence or abuse may also be reluctant to provide information, \nespecially against the alleged perpetrator. Officers should be alert to such cases and will ensure \nto the extent possible that specific accommodations are made during interviews as set out  \n(e.g., have a female officer either conduct or be present during an interview, and arrange, if \npossible, for a female interpreter). See section 6.6.4 below for additional guidance on \nconducting interviews. \n \nVictims and survivors of GBV may be encountered both at the port of entry or inland.

Officers cannot assign the discretionary \nauthority to another person, nor can another person fetter an officer’s discretion by obliging an \nofficer to do or not do something that is at the officer’s discretion. However, once a report is \nprepared under A44(1), it must be transmitted to the MD. \n \nAlthough an A44(1) report may result from an examination, an examination is not a necessary \nprerequisite for an officer to prepare and transmit a report to the MD. This is due to the fact that \nofficers are only authorized to proceed with an examination under prescribed circumstances.   \nFor further information regarding the examination process, please refer to section 11.4, \n‘Procedure: Overview of the examination process’ and ENF 4 Port of Entry Examinations. \n \nThe wording of A44(1) allows an officer to prepare a report in relation to a permanent resident or \na foreign national “who is in Canada”. In most cases, particularly in regards to foreign nationals, \nthe inadmissibility will be directly linked to the person’s physical presence in Canada (e.g., non-\ncompliance with A29(2) for remaining in Canada beyond the period authorized). In general, an \nofficer will only prepare an A44(1) report where the person is physically present in Canada, \nhowever this requirement must be considered in context. Where an officer receives credible \nevidence that a foreign national or permanent resident is no longer in Canada, the officer should \nnot proceed to write a report under A44(1). However, given that permanent residents have a \nright of entry and may be out of Canada for a number of reasons (e.g., vacation, work, etc.), it \nmay be reasonable for an officer to proceed to write an A44(1) report against a permanent \nresident without confirming that the permanent resident is physically present in Canada at the \ntime of the writing of A44(1) report, as long as procedural fairness requirements have been met. \nThis will also depend on the facts and circumstances of the case and may only be considered \nwhere there is no credible information to suggest that the person is no longer residing in \nCanada.  \n \n7.2 Procedure: Evidentiary requirements \n \nTo form the opinion that a person is inadmissible to Canada, an officer must have knowledge of \nthe evidentiary rules and requirements for immigration matters. Knowledge of what may be \nrequired to substantiate an allegation of inadmissibility is an important consideration in all cases. \nEach allegation has specific requirements for evidence and officers are to be guided by the \ncontent of ENF 1 Inadmissibility; ENF 2 Evaluating Inadmissibility; and ENF 18 Human or \ninternational rights violations. \n \nBefore officers make a decision to write a report under A44(1), they must be satisfied that the \napplicable burden and standard of proof can be met and that sufficient evidence has been or \nmay be gathered to ensure that each element of an inadmissibility allegation can be satisfied. \n \n \n7.3 Burden of proof \n \nThe burden of proof, in the context of immigration legislation, refers to who is responsible for \nestablishing admissibility under the IRPA. \n \n"

In \nother words, the scope of discretion has been viewed as “variable and flexible”.8 \n \nFor example, in Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. Cha, 2006 \nFCA 126, a case involving a foreign national inadmissible under paragraph 36(2)(a) of the IRPA, \nthe Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) outlined that the particular circumstances of a foreign \nnational, the nature of the offence, the conviction, and the sentence are beyond the reach of an \nofficer when considering whether or not to write an A44(1) report for criminality or serious \ncriminality against a foreign national.  \n \nMore recent jurisprudence9 confirms that officers making decisions under A44 have very limited \ndiscretion, particularly in matters concerning serious criminality and organized criminality, and \nthat there is no obligation to consider factors related to humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) \nor ‘personal circumstances’. These decisions also confirm that at this the 44 stage, officers and \nMDs are conducting a fact-finding mission into “readily and objectively ascertainable facts” and \nthat this administrative screening function applies to both foreign nationals and permanent \nresidents. \n \nIn all cases, officers must carefully consider the consequences of not writing an A44(1) report as \na means of creating a formal record of an inadmissibility, given that this decision may have an \nimpact on possible future dealings with the person. This will be particularly important in cases \ninvolving security (A34), violation of human or international rights(A35), sanctions (A35.1), \nserious criminality [A36(1)] and organized criminality (A37), regardless of the status of the \nindividual. In such cases, it is important to have a formal record of that inadmissibility. This is \nbest accomplished by preparing an A44(1) report. \n \n                                               \n8 Sharma v.

However, where an officer’s decision does not have a corresponding \nrecord in GCMS, officers should record their decision, rationale and any specific circumstances \nconsidered in their decision in GCMS notes. \n \n8.2 Priority Cases: Inadmissibility under A34, A35, A35.1, A36(1) and A37 of the \nIRPA \n  \nIt was affirmed by the FCA in Sharma v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), \n2016 FCA 319, that within the context of A44, officers and the MD must always be mindful of \nParliament’s intention in drafting the IRPA to make security of Canadians a top priority. \n \nIn Sharma, the FCA also concluded that the Court’s rationale in Cha in support of a limited \ndiscretion under A44 would appear to apply equally to both foreign nationals and permanent \nresidents. \n \nAlthough the factors contained in these guidelines may be considered when writing an A44(1) \nreport, an officer must always consider the various objectives of the IRPA, in particular A3(1)(h) \nand (i). As suggested by Federal Court of Canada jurisprudence, in cases of inadmissibility \nunder A34, A35, A36(1) and A37, the scope of discretion enjoyed by officers making a decision \nregarding whether or not to write an A44(1) report will be very narrow and it generally is \nreasonably open to an officer or an MD to prioritize public safety and security. \n \n \n9 A44(1) reports concerning foreign nationals  \n \n9.1 Considerations before writing an A44(1) report \n \nKeeping in mind the scope of discretion related to considerations for writing an A44(1) report \noutlined in section 8 of these guidelines, the following non-exhaustive factors may be \nconsidered when exercising the limited discretion under A44(1) with respect to foreign nationals \n(including officer options at the port of entry such as allowing the person to withdraw their \napplication to enter Canada under R42): \n \n \nHas the person been granted protected person status in Canada? What is the nature or \ncategory of the inadmissibility? \n \nIs the person already the subject of a removal order? \n \nIs the person already the subject of a separate inadmissibility report incorporating \nallegations that will likely result in a removal order? \n \nIs the officer satisfied that the person is, or soon will be, leaving Canada on their own \nvolition? And in such a case, is the imposition of a future requirement to obtain an \nauthorization to return warranted? \n \nIs there a record of the person having previously contravened immigration legislation? \n \nIn the case of non-compliance, was it unintentional or excusable for a valid reason? \n \nHas the person now been fully counselled on the topic of their inadmissibility? And is the \nofficer satisfied that the person now understands what is required in future to overcome \ntheir inadmissibility? \n"

Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2006 FC 469]. Officers should also keep in mind \nthat the Federal Court has made findings to support the principle that officials carrying out \nA44(1) and (2) assessments are not obliged to speculate about how and when future \ndeportation might take place [Faci v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), \n2011 FC 693]. \n \nIn cases of protected persons, officers may also consider as an additional factor in their \nrecommendation to the MD, whether the facts of the case would support a referral for a \nMinisterial opinion (‘Danger Opinion’) under A115(2). For further information, see section 14.5, \n‘Overview:  Minister's opinions/interventions’. \n \n9.3 Dual intent  \n \nA22(2) states that the intention of a foreign national to become a permanent resident does not \npreclude them from becoming a temporary resident if the officer is satisfied that the person will \nleave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.  \n \nDual intent is present when a foreign national who has applied for permanent residence in \nCanada (or is entitled to apply for permanent residence within Canada) also seeks to enter \nCanada for a temporary period as a visitor, worker or student. If an officer has concerns/doubts \nabout the foreign national's bona fides, the foreign national must be made aware of these \nconcerns and given an opportunity to respond to them.  \n \nSome examples of dual intent could include: \n \n \na foreign national frequently visiting a Canadian spouse who has complied with \nprevious conditions of entry and is otherwise not inadmissible, even if an application \n"

For further information, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations, section 15.5, \n‘GCMS remarks’.  \n \nTRPs should only be issued after careful consideration of all assessment factors as the \ndocument carries privileges greater than those accorded to other visitors, students and workers \nwith temporary resident status.  Before issuing a TRP, an officer must consult the departmental \nand agency guidelines on risk assessment factors and procedures for issuing TRPs. This \napplies to both initial and subsequent TRPs.  \n \nWhere an officer does not have the authority to issue a TRP but has reviewed the case and is \nrecommending the issuance of a TRP, the officer must prepare a written a case summary that \nincludes a recommendation for a final decision.  The officer will refer the case file to the \ndecision-maker with the designated authority to issue a TRP for a final determination. If the \ndecision is made to issue a TRP, the decision-maker will determine the period of validity of the \nTRP.  \n \nFor further instructions and procedures for TRPs, officers must refer to the IRCC Program \ndelivery instructions on Temporary resident permits and ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. \n \nAdditional considerations for TRP issuance: \n \n \nA person is not eligible for a TRP if less than 12 months have passed since their \nclaim for refugee protection was last rejected [or determined to be withdrawn or \nabandoned as described under A24(4)]. \nException: The one-year ban on accessing a TRP under A24(4) does not bar an \nIRCC officer, on their own initiative, from considering a TRP for a victim of human \ntrafficking. \n \nThere are specific IRCC policy guidelines respecting certain vulnerable persons \nincluding suspected or known victims of human trafficking or victims of family \nviolence.  Only IRCC officials may issue TRPs to victims of human trafficking or victims \nof family violence, however CBSA officials should follow the procedures set out in the \nProgram delivery instructions above for handling these cases. \n \nIf a student, worker or visitor with valid temporary resident status is reported \nunder A44(1) but a decision is made not to hold an admissibility hearing or issue a \nremoval order, that person remains a temporary resident, and a TRP is not required \n \n9.8 A44(1) reports for inadmissible family members \n \nOfficers should be aware that they may need to assemble information about the family members \nof a person who is the subject of an A44(1) report and decide whether family members should \n"

This provision may only apply to family members who are foreign nationals, \nother than protected persons. \n \nOfficers should always consider reporting family members in order to avoid separating families \nor having other family members abandoned when one member must be removed from Canada. \n \nR1(3) provides that: \n \n1.(3) For the purposes of the Act, other than section 12 and paragraph 38(2)(d), and for the \npurposes of these Regulations, other than paragraph 7.1 (3)(a) and sections 159.1 and 159.5, \n\"family member\" in respect of a person means: \n \n(a) \nthe spouse or common-law partner of the person; \n(b) \na dependent child of the person or of the person’s spouse or common-law \npartner; and \n(c) \na dependent child of a dependent child referred to in paragraph (b). \n \nOfficers should note that under A42, a foreign national who is a temporary resident, applying to \nenter or remain as a temporary resident and has a family member who is inadmissible under \nA34, A35, A35.1 or A37, is inadmissible to Canada whether they are accompanying them or not. \nIt is also important to note that pursuant to the exceptions set out under A42(2), foreign \nnationals seeking temporary resident status who have an accompanying or non-accompanying \nfamily member who is inadmissible under any of the other provisions (A36, A38, A39, A40 or \nA41) of the IRPA cannot be reported under A42.   \n \nWhere an officer writes an A44(1) report against a family member for inadmissibility under A42, \nthe MD has jurisdiction under R228 to issue the applicable removal order.

In general, these public policies grant temporary remedies or exemptions for certain IRPA \nrequirements for certain categories of persons who meet specified criteria set out in the policy. \nThey are generally in place for a specific and temporary period of time, however, some public \npolicies may remain in place for an extended period. Officers should ensure that they follow any \nnew guidance or instructions related to new public policies. \n \nOfficers should be aware that, unless a public policy specifies that a person is excluded from \ncertain requirements under the IRPA or the IRPR, all other legislative obligations and \ninadmissibility provisions continue to apply. \n \n \n10 A44(1) reports concerning permanent residents of Canada \n \nWhile permanent residents are given an opportunity to make submissions as part of procedural \nfairness during the A44 process, they cannot be compelled to attend an interview, answer \nquestions or provide submissions. As noted in section 11.7, permanent residents are only \nsubject to an obligation to answer questions when subject to examination at a port of entry, and \nonly insofar as it relates to establishing that they hold permanent resident status. \n \nThe submissions and evidence provided on behalf of a permanent resident should be reviewed \non a case-by-case basis and an officer must clearly articulate which factors were considered.  \n \nOfficers must ensure that all relevant factors have been addressed in their written \nrecommendation to the MD and may best achieve this by preparing a narrative report under \nA44(1), which is to accompany the A44(1) report when it is transmitted to the MD. Officers must \nalso ensure that they forward to the MD all submissions and documents filed by the person \nconcerned as well as any other evidence relied on in the officer’s recommendation.  \n \nIn Hernandez v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2007 FC \n725, the Federal Court held that while a narrative report is not required when referring the \nA44(1) report to the MD, where the officer has prepared such a report, all accompanying notes \nor appendices must be provided to the MD in full. The court also held that once such material is \ncreated and delivered to the Minister, it must be provided to the person concerned prior to the \nadmissibility hearing – this is particularly so when a specific request has been made. \n \nSee Appendix E:  Sample A44(1) Narrative report.   \n \n"

For example, where there are \nconflicting versions of events pertaining to a criminal offence, an explanation as to why one \nversion is being relied on over the other should be provided in the officer’s recommendation.  \n \n10.1 A44(1) reports for criminality cases  \n \nIn Medovarski v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration); Esteban v. Canada (Minister \nof Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 51, the SCC stated that the objectives in the IRPA \nreflect an intent to prioritize security and that this objective is given effect by removing persons \nwith criminal records from Canada. The SCC noted that in drafting the IRPA, Parliament \ndemonstrated a strong desire to treat criminals less leniently than under the former Immigration \nAct. This was noted in Sharma, where the FCA affirmed that officers and MDs, when dealing \nwith matters under A44(1) and A44(2), must always be mindful of the various objectives of the \nIRPA, in particular A3(1)(h) and (i). The FCA also concluded that the Court’s rationale in Cha in \nsupport of a limited discretion under A44 would appear to apply equally to both foreign nationals \nand permanent residents.  \n \nIt is strongly urged that, whenever possible, officers who prepare the A44(1) report in serious \ncriminality cases obtain detailed documentation to support the assessment. Hearings Officers \nwill also find this documentation essential when presenting the case before the ID or when \ndefending a removal order that is challenged at the IAD. \n \nThree principal factors indicate the seriousness of an offence:  \n \n \nthe circumstances of the particular incident under consideration;  \n \nthe sentence imposed; and  \n \nthe maximum sentence that could have been imposed.  \n \nThe fact that a conviction falls within A36(1) is itself an indication of its seriousness for \nimmigration purposes. It is also important for officers to be aware that sentences imposed by the \ncourts may have been subject to plea bargaining. The Crown may agree to a reduced sentence \nif the person pleads guilty. The circumstances of the crime are not viewed less seriously, but \nsaving the court the time and expense of a full trial is taken into consideration in determining the \nsentence.  \n \nThe best documentation is a transcript of the trial judge's remarks on conviction or sentencing, \ncommonly known as the Judge's Reasons for Sentence.

For example, the officer may state in their decision: “I am not \nexercising my discretion to consider evidence and/or submissions filed on behalf of (name of \nperson concerned) pertaining to their personal circumstances given the seriousness of the \nreportable offence”.  \n \nIf an officer exercises discretion to consider personal circumstances \n \nWhile the courts have affirmed that an officer is not required to consider personal \ncircumstances, if an officer does exercise their discretion to consider such factors, they must \nensure that the factors considered are weighed in a fair manner and render a decision that is \n“justified, intelligible and transparent”.12 Any assessment of a person’s personal circumstances \nmust be reasonable in the circumstances of the case.

In general terms, examinations will end \nwhen an officer makes a decision on the application before them or, in cases referred to the \nMD, when a decision has been made.  \n \nAt a port of entry, with the exception of refugee claimants, persons seeking to enter or transit \nthrough Canada remain subject to an examination until: \n \n(a) a determination is made that the person has a right to enter Canada, or is authorized \nto enter Canada as a temporary resident or permanent resident, the person is authorized \nto leave the port of entry at which the examination takes place and the person leaves the \nport of entry; \n(b) if the person is an in-transit passenger, the person departs from Canada; \n(c) the person is authorized to withdraw their application to enter Canada and an officer \nverifies their departure from Canada; or \n(d) a decision in respect of the person is made under subsection 44(2) of the Act and the \nperson leaves the port of entry. \n"

Such re-examinations may result in an A44(1) report.  \n \nIt should be noted by officers at the port of entry that while permanent residents are subject to \nexamination when seeking entry, the IRPA gives permanent residents of Canada the right to \nenter Canada at a port of entry pursuant to A19(2) once the officer is satisfied that the person \nholds permanent resident status. The obligation to answer truthfully under A16(1) for permanent \nresidents is linked to A18(1) and must be related to examination for the purpose of establishing \nthat the person holds permanent resident status in Canada.   \n \nWhile an officer who is satisfied at examination that a person holds permanent resident status \nmust admit that person, the officer may also form an opinion during examination that the \npermanent resident is inadmissible for other reasons under the IRPA. In such cases, the officer \nshould advise the person that while it has been established that they have a right to enter \nCanada, there are reasons to believe that they could become the subject of a report under the \nIRPA which could lead to the issuance of a removal order. If the person wishes to continue \nanswering questions or providing information/submissions pertaining to the allegation, they \nshould be given an opportunity but are not required to do so.

For that purpose, the officer must provide the \nperson concerned with an interpreter if required. \n \nThe person concerned must also be given the opportunity to have counsel present at the \ninterview. This is not to be confused with an unqualified right to have counsel present, however \nas already set out in section 6.5, detained individuals have the right to have a counsel of their \nchoosing present during the interview. Officers must inform persons of their right to counsel \nprior to commencing the interview. This right applies in all cases where a person is detained \nunder an Act of Parliament and includes situations where the person is detained by the criminal \ncourts while facing charges or serving a sentence. As stated in previous sections, all detained \ncases should be interviewed in person. \n \nSee Appendix D:  Sample Call-in letter for interview- Person no longer subject to \nexamination (includes permanent resident and protected person) \n \nReasonable efforts should be made to ensure that the notification letter is delivered to the most \ncurrent address of the person concerned. Where appropriate, this may include a site visit and/or \ntelephone call. This will be particularly important in cases where the loss of appeal rights under \nA64 may be involved. See section 11.10, ‘Procedure:  Failure to appear at A44(1) interview’. \n \n11.9 Procedure for submissions where no in-person interview is held: Persons no \nlonger subject to examination \n \nThe Federal Court affirmed in Hernandez v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency \nPreparedness), 2007 FC 725, a case involving a permanent resident of Canada, that an oral \ninterview by the officer at the A44(1) stage is not always required, as long as the affected \nperson is given an opportunity to make submissions and to know the case against them. This \nprinciple was affirmed in Sharma v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), \n[2017] 3 FCR 492, 2016 FCA 319. In that case, the FCA also confirmed that the duty of fairness \ndoes not require that the A44(1) report is put before the person before a decision is made by the \nMD to refer that report to the ID pursuant to A44(2), provided that such a report is \ncommunicated to the affected person before the hearing of the Immigration Division. In other \nwords, officers must ensure that the report under A44(1) is provided to the person concerned \nbefore the hearing of the ID. As a matter of practice, disclosure of the report will usually occur at \nthe time that the admissibility hearing package is served on the permanent resident by a \nHearings Officer or Hearings Advisor in advance of the hearing, in accordance with the ID Rules \nfor disclosure. \n \nWhere an officer elects not to proceed by way of an in-person interview and elects to proceed \nby way of written submissions, the officer must notify the person concerned in writing of the \nallegation and the process to be followed, and provide them with an opportunity and reasonable \ntime to provide submissions and information related to their case.  \n \nSee Appendix B:   Sample letter to be sent where no interview is requested- Person no \nlonger subject to examination (includes permanent resident and protected person) \n"

The officer’s decision \nmust be issued in writing and provided to the person concerned. \n \nAs already noted, permanent residents (and foreign nationals who are no longer subject to \nexamination) cannot be compelled to provide submissions or otherwise be required to \nparticipate in the A44(1) process. Where reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the \nperson concerned has been notified of the A44 process and no submissions are received or the \nperson concerned has expressly declined to participate in the A44(1) process, the officer may \nproceed to write an A44(1) report based on all relevant evidence available and refer the report \nto be reviewed by an MD under A44(2).    \n \n11.10 Procedure:  Failure to appear at A44(1) interview \n \nIf the person concerned does not appear for an interview on the date specified in the call-in \nletter and the responsible officer and/or office where the A44(1) investigation originated has not \nreceived notice or other indication from the person concerned stating why they were unable to \nattend the interview, then officers should make reasonable efforts to locate the person, including \nreasonable efforts to determine the reasons for the no-show (e.g., letter to the last known \naddress, site visit and/or telephone call).

There \nmay be cases where an officer is pursuing enforcement under the IRPA for serious \ninadmissibility and the person constitutes either a danger to the public or a significant flight risk. \nFor example, criminal intelligence exists that the person is committing crimes of a violent nature, \nis a security risk or is involved in organized crime, etc. In such cases where an arrest and \ndetention is necessary, it may be appropriate that the A44(1) report be written and a decision to \nrefer the matter to the ID be made without advising the client prior to the arrest. In such \nexceptional cases, officers must first document their recommendation, consult with their \nmanager regarding this proposed course of action and receive concurrence before proceeding. \nIf an arrest takes place, the officer will then provide the individual with a copy of the A44(1) \nreport. If the matter concerns a permanent resident or a protected person and they wish to \nmake submissions at that point, the officers will provide them with a reasonable opportunity to \ndo so and will forward the submission to the MD for review.  \n \n12.2 Evidence of pending or withdrawn charges \n \nOfficers must be careful about how they rely on evidence of charges which did not lead to a \nconviction. In McAlpin v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2018 FC 422, \nChief Justice Crampton held that in exercising discretion to refer an individual for admissibility \nhearing, it is reasonable for the Minister or his delegate to place significant weight on the \nnumber of interactions that a person who is the subject of an A44(1) report has had with the law. \nJustice Crampton also found that while the Federal Court has previously found that pending or \nwithdrawn charges may be considered by an officer or an MD in determinations under A44(1) \nand A44(2) and certain other contexts that arise under the IRPA, provided that such evidence is \nfound to be credible and trustworthy14, officers must be mindful that there are limitations to the \nway such evidence is used and officers should not treat the existence of withdrawn charges on \ntheir face as evidence of a person’s history of criminality.   \n \nOfficers must also be careful not to rely on convictions for which rehabilitation or a record \nsuspension has been granted as evidence of a criminal record. \n \n12.3 Offences under the Youth Criminal Justice Act  \n \nOfficers must ensure that they do not rely on or refer to youth offences in their determination, \nexcept where access is authorized under the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA). Information \nthat is not accessible under the provisions of the YCJA cannot be considered and must not be \nincluded or referenced at any point during A44 proceedings. Moreover, contravention of the \nprovisions of the YCJA is a serious matter. \n \nThe importance of verifying whether information is protected by YCJA provisions was \nhighlighted in Abdi v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) 2017 FC 950. In \n                                               \n14 Sittampalam v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FCA 326; Thuraisingam v \nCanada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 607; Kharrat v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), \n2007 FC 842 \n"

However, the MD’s reliance on youth offences that were \nwithdrawn or dismissed was unreasonable since section 119(2)(c) of the YCJA allows access to \nthese records for only a brief period after dismissal or withdrawal of the youth charges and the \naccess period to such charges had expired. \n \nOfficers conducting A44(1) and A44(2) functions must ensure that they only rely on youth \nrecords to which access is not restricted under the YCJA. It is therefore important for officers to \nbe aware of the provisions of the YCJA which relate to access to youth records.  \n \n12.4 Privacy and information sharing \n \nWhile information sharing is vital to protecting the safety and security of Canadians, the sharing \nof information must be done in a manner which complies with Canada's laws and legal \nobligations. When obtaining and disclosing information obtained from a third party, including a \nforeign government, officers must be aware of their legal obligations under information sharing \nagreements and legislation. In all cases, officers are required to assess the accuracy and \nreliability of information received, and properly characterize this information in any further \ndissemination.  \n \nAll information sharing activities must also comply with the Security of Canada Information \nDisclosure Act (SCIDA)15. The SCIDA provides the authorities for all Government of Canada \ninstitutions respecting the disclosure of information related to national security, including \npersonal information, in order to protect Canada against activities that undermine the security of \nCanada. \n \nWhen obtaining or assessing evidence at A44, officers must ensure that any and all information \nsharing activities comply with applicable information sharing legislation as well as all relevant \ndepartmental and agency information sharing policies. For further information, CBSA and IRCC \nofficers should consult their respective Agency/Departmental information sharing guidance, \npolicies and toolkits. \n \n12.4.1 Evidence obtained by mistreatment or torture \n \nIn addition to ensuring that information is shared in a manner that complies with Canada's laws \nand legal obligations, officers must avoid knowingly contributing to mistreatment of persons by \nforeign entities. Bill C-59 gained Royal Assent in June 2019, thereby establishing the Avoiding \nComplicity in Mistreatment by Foreign Entities Act (ACA). Pursuant to subsection 3(2) of the \nACA, a new Order in Council (OiC) issued to the CBSA in July 2019, which prescribes the \ndirections for avoiding complicity in mistreatment by foreign entities. The OiC prohibits: \n \n• \nthe disclosure of information that would result in a substantial risk of mistreatment of \nan individual by a foreign entity; \n• \nthe making of requests for information that would result in a substantial risk of \nmistreatment of an individual by a foreign entity; and \n                                               \n15 The Security of Canada Information Sharing Act (SCISA) was the previous legislation for national \nsecurity information sharing. SCISA was amended and renamed SCIDA after Bill C-59, An Act respecting \nnational security matters, received Royal Assent in June 2019. \n \n"

However, the Federal Court has recognized that \neach case must turn on its facts and that not every document considered by an officer must be \ndisclosed at the A44 stage. The main question is whether the person has had the opportunity to \nmeaningfully participate in the decision-making process [Karahroudi v Canada (Citizenship and \nImmigration), 2016 FC 522, [2017] 1 FCR 167; Gebremedhin v Canada (Minister of Citizenship \nand Immigration), 2013 FC 380; Bhagwandass v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and \nImmigration), 2001 FCA 49]. \n \nOfficers should keep in mind that where there is relevant information before them which cannot \nbe disclosed to the person due to privacy or information sharing legislation, and where the \nofficer cannot obtain authorization to disclose the document with appropriate redactions, the \ninformation should not be relied upon in the officer’s reasons. There are exceptions where the \nduty of fairness can be met without having to furnish all the documents and reports the decision-\nmaker relied on, such as where a document is protected by privilege based on national security \nor on the solicitor-client relationship, however officers should be careful not to rely specifically \non documents which cannot be disclosed. This position is consistent with Federal Court \njurisprudence [for example, Moghaddam v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC \n1063].   \n \nWhere officers receive a request for disclosure of documents at the A44(1) stage, officers \nshould turn their minds to whether the information sought is “material and otherwise unknown \nand unavailable to the person concerned”. Where the information is not material (i.e., not \nbeing relied on in the offer’s assessment) or is otherwise known or available to the person \nconcerned (e.g., a person’s criminal court records which they could access through a request), \nthe officer is not subject to a duty to disclose and this may form the rationale for refusing to \ndisclose it. An officer may still need to refuse to disclose on other grounds. In all cases, it is \nimportant for the officer to provide a rationale for the refusal. [for further information, see Durkin \nv. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 174]. \n \nIn Jeffrey v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 1180, the Federal \nCourt relied on Durkin and concluded that the Minister does not have a duty to disclose \ninformation other than that which is “material and otherwise unknown or unavailable to the \nperson” until after a decision has been made under A44(2) to hold an admissibility hearing. The \ncourt found that in the circumstances of the case, the officer was not subject to any duty to \nprovide the disclosure sought by the applicant where the applicant was: \n \nadvised of the reason why an inadmissibility report may be prepared pursuant to A44(1); \n \ninformed of the nature of the specific allegations being considered; \n \nprovided an opportunity to respond to those allegations;  \n \ninformed of what the relevant information in the officer’s possession consisted of; and  \n \nadvised that copies of the information sought would not be provided since the applicant \neither provided that information or was present during the interviews where the \ninformation was obtained. \n \n"

It sets out the allegation and \nthe underlining facts necessary to support the allegation. The report should not contain \ninformation which is unrelated to the allegation (e.g., issues related to grounds for detention or \nthe person’s full immigration history) or opinions of the officer and should be restricted to facts \nwhich support the allegation. \n  \nSince the A44(1) report is an allegation, not evidence, any additional information obtained \nduring an interview which an officer wishes to include in support of the report should be \nprovided by way of a separate statutory declaration from the officer.  \n \nThe authority of the MD to cause an admissibility hearing or issue a removal order cannot be \nexercised unless the form and content of a report under A44(1) comply with specific \nrequirements and contain required information relating to the IRPA inadmissibility upon which \nthe report is based.  \n \nWhen an officer is of the opinion that a permanent resident or foreign national in Canada is \ninadmissible, then that officer may prepare a report under A44(1). \n \nThe report shall then be transmitted to the MD, along with any forms containing the officer’s \ndisposition, recommendation and rationale. This may be best accomplished by preparing an \nA44(1) case highlights form IMM 5084B  (for inland cases) or BSF516 (for port of entry cases). \nFor more complex cases, this may also be accomplished by way of a detailed memorandum or \nA44(1) narrative report (e.g., for permanent residents and protected persons).

This means that the report must cite both A41 and the specific IRPA provision \nthat is the subject of the non-compliance (i.e., provision of the IRPA or the IRPR contravened); \nthis structure is necessary in order to determine whether the jurisdiction to issue a removal \norder falls under the MD (R228) or the ID (R229).   \n \nOfficers must also include the specific grounds for the non-compliance in the comments of the \nnarrative portion of the A44(1) report, under the heading: “This report is based on the following \ninformation that the above-named individual:”. In other words, the description of the particular \ncontravention of an IRPA requirement (e.g., person’s failure to leave Canada by the end of the \nperiod authorized for their stay) and any specific reference to a provision of the IRPA or the \nIRPR  are to be incorporated in the officer’s narrative justifying the inadmissibility allegation.  \n \nFor further information on the elements of non-compliance under A41, see ENF 2/OP18 \nEvaluating Inadmissibility. \n \n13.4 Multiple allegations \n \nWhere the person is inadmissible under multiple provisions of the IRPA, it is generally \nrecommended that the officer writes a separate report for each allegation. The MD will then \nmake a determination on each report during the A44(2) process.  \n \nIf an officer is considering whether to write two separate inadmissibility reports on the same \nperson, and if the objectives of the IRPA would not be further served by pursuing a removal \norder for an additional allegation for which the ID has jurisdiction, then the officer may use \ndiscretion and not write an A44(1) report containing the allegation for which the ID has \njurisdiction [R228(1) and R229(1)]. For example, an allegation may not be worth pursuing \nbecause it will not affect the eligibility of a claim for refugee protection under A101, or because \nthe MD may issue an exclusion order based on the other allegations and there is no concern \nthat the person will be able to return to Canada without consent after one year.  However, it is \nimportant to keep in mind the objectives of the IRPA: depending on the circumstances of the \ncase, these objectives may be best served by writing an A44(1) report as a future record of the \ninadmissibility. In such cases, an officer may choose to write the A44(1) report but recommend \nno further action as the A44(2) disposition. \n \nThere may be instances where an officer, after preparing or reviewing an A44(1) report, finds: \n \n \nthat the grounds cited in the report are not valid, but in the officer’s opinion, the person \nfalls within some other inadmissible class; or \n"

The officer cannot simply amend the \nexisting A44(1) report. Whether a new A44(1) report is written to replace a previous report or to \nreport a new inadmissibility ground, in either case the officer must ensure that the person \nconcerned is accorded the earliest possible notice of all the grounds against them in \naccordance with the rules of natural justice. \n \nIf an officer, during the course of an investigation, comes across evidence to support new \nallegations which fall within the jurisdiction of the ID where an existing A44(1) report has already \nbeen referred to the ID, the officer should contact the Hearings Officer to determine next steps, \nincluding whether the additional grounds of inadmissibility should be dealt with at the hearing \nsimultaneously.  \n \nThere may be instances where multiple allegations are contained within the same report. This \npractice is generally discouraged, especially where the jurisdiction for each inadmissibility does \nnot lie with the same decision-maker (i.e., MD or ID). It should be noted, however, that where a \nreport contains one or more inadmissibility allegation, and if the MD has jurisdiction for all \ninadmissibility allegations contained within that report, the MD can determine the disposition of \nthat report. Conversely, where there are several inadmissibility allegations in a report and the \nMD has jurisdiction for only some of them, the MD is not authorized to determine a disposition \nfor that report, and all allegations must be referred to the ID. \n \nAs set out in section 8 above, discretion under A44 means that officers and MDs have some \nflexibility in managing cases where the person is inadmissible, and assessing whether the \nobjectives of the IRPA may or will be achieved without the need to seek a removal order or write \na formal inadmissibility report under A44(1). Officers should note, however, that where the same \nevidence supports multiple allegations of inadmissibility, they should consider the fact that not \npursuing a particular allegation until a later date may give rise to an abuse of process argument \nby the person concerned. This does not mean an A44(1) report should be written in \ncircumstances where the officer is still in the process of gathering further evidence in relation to \none or more inadmissibility ground, and officers will need to balance whether the objectives of \nthe IRPA would be served by writing a report for all possible allegations or proceeding with only \ncertain allegations at a given point in time.  \n \nExample:  A CBSA officer is investigating a permanent resident for inadmissibility for serious \ncriminality under A36(1)(b). The CBSA officer has obtained evidence to support an A44(1) \nreport for the allegation, but has determined that the evidence further supports an A44(1) report \nfor A40(1)(a) based on misrepresentation on the person’s application for permanent residence. \nIt may later be seen or determined by the Courts to be an abuse of process if the officer does \nnot pursue the A40(1)(a) report at the same time as the A36(1)(b) report. On the other hand, \nusing this same scenario as an example, if the officer is also investigating possible \ninadmissibility for organized criminality under A37(1)(a) but is still in the process of gathering \nevidence to establish this allegation, abuse of process is less likely to arise, even if there is \noverlapping evidence in both allegations. In this situation, however, the officer should consider \nwhether to wait until the investigation into the A37(1)(a) allegation is complete before \nproceeding to write the report for A36(1)(b)/ referring it to the MD.  \n \n \n \n \n"

Wherever \npossible, an officer who writes an A44(1) report must also provide a copy of that report to the \nperson concerned.  \n \nIn cases where a report is prepared as a consequence of an examination (such as at a port of \nentry) or in any other case where the person concerned is on site and/or otherwise available to \nreceive a copy of the report, then a copy of the report should be given to the person concerned. \nIn such cases, officers should also counsel a person who is the subject of an A44(1) report on \nthe following matters, as appropriate:  \n \n \nthe reason why the report was prepared (or in the case of an R41 “Direct Back,” may \nbe prepared); \n \nthe date and time the person should return if the MD was not available to consider a \nreport prepared (or that may be prepared) if the person chooses to return and pursue \ntheir entry request with respect to that person [R41(b)]; \n \nif the review by the MD is to be conducted at a place other than where the report was \ncompleted, appropriate instructions, such as where the office is located and how to \nget there; \n \nthe purpose of the review and the options available to the MD. \n \nWhere entry seems justified in the circumstances, officers should also inform persons about the \noption to apply for a TRP and about the cost recovery fee.

Where the ID has jurisdiction, \ndisclosure of the report may occur at the time the admissibility hearing disclosure package is \nserved on the person concerned. As mentioned in previous sections, the Federal Court of \nAppeal has confirmed that the duty of fairness does not require that the A44(1) report is put \nbefore the person before a decision is made by the MD to refer that report to the ID pursuant to  \nA44(2) as long as the affected person is given an opportunity to make submissions and to know \nthe case against them.

There may be circumstances where an \nMD is not physically on site and/or otherwise available to conduct a review under A44(2) in \nperson and where deferring the MD review is not a viable option.  In such circumstances, \nofficers shall refer to ENF 6, section 10.7, ‘ Procedure: Reviewing A44(1) reports when a \nMinister’s Delegate is not on site’. \n \n14.4 Amending the A44(1) report \n \nThere is no mechanism to directly amend an existing A44(1) report in GCMS, therefore at the \ntime the report is being created, officers must ensure that the proper allegations are selected \nand the contents of the narrative section of the A44(1) report are accurate before finalizing the \ndocument.  \n \nThere are instances, however, where errors in an A44(1) report are identified following a review \nof the report after its issuance has been finalized. In such cases, it is important for officers to \ntake appropriate steps to make necessary corrections, taking into account the nature of the \nerror/information to be changed and the stage during which the error is identified.     \n \nWhere, following the issuance of the A44(1) report, an error is identified which does not affect \nthe substance of the report (for example, a typographical error regarding the date of a \nconviction) or it is determined that a change is warranted with respect to the wording in the \nnarrative section of the report, the officer who issued the original A44(1) report may write an \nupdated report in GCMS reflecting the appropriate corrections prior to review by the MD. Where \nthe error is discovered by the MD, it remains open to the MD to send the matter back to the \nofficer so that appropriate corrections may be made or for the officer to consider writing a new \nA44(1) report. In such cases, where a new A44(1) report is written to replace an existing report, \nofficers must ensure the previous report is cancelled in GCMS in accordance with the  \nprocedures set out in the GCMS guidelines, including the creation of any process notes as \nrequired. In such cases, the person concerned should be provided with a copy of the amended \nreport in accordance with the procedural fairness requirements outlined in previous sections of \nthese guidelines at some point prior to the proceeding that may result in the issuance of a \nremoval order (e.g., Minister’s Delegate review or admissibility hearing). \n \nNote:  There is a specific process to be followed in GCMS where the MD decides to return the \nA44(1) to the officer. Based on errors or new information identified by the MD, the officer may \ncreate a new A44(1) report by following GCMS procedures for issuing a new A44 report after \nMD returns the report to an officer.  \n \nCBSA officers may consult the GCMS Help Centre for guidance on GCMS procedures where \nthe MD returns the A44 report to an officer.   \n \nIt is also important to note that there are circumstances in which amendments to an A44(1) \n"

      "text": "ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports \n \n \n2025-02-20 \n53 \n \n \nreport may be made after the report has been referred to the ID, without the need for a new \nreferral under A44(2). While it is generally preferred that amendments be made by way of \nwriting a new A44(1) report containing the amended wording, there may be circumstances \nwhere amendments to the report can be made at the admissibility hearing stage, however, this \nis only possible where the amendment does not affect the substance of the report. For example, \nin Clare v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2016 FC 545, the Minister filed a Notice of \nAmendment to the A44(1) report, after the report had already been referred to the ID. The notice \nitself stated that the amendment did not represent a change in the substance of the original \nreport. The narrative section of the revised version replaced the reference to a particular \nsubsection of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act with reference to a provision under the \nCriminal Code of Canada. The Federal Court found that the amendment to the A44(1) report did \nnot need to be submitted to the MD for a fresh determination on a referral to the ID, so long as \nthe amendment conformed generally to the description of the alleged illegal conduct in the \noriginal report and identified an offence that was punishable by a maximum of at least ten years \nimprisonment. Relying on Uppal v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC \n338, the Federal Court found that the question was whether the amendment was so significant \nthat it required a fresh consideration by the MD, and held that the ID had reasonably relied on \nthe amended report because there was no substantive change in the description of the offence \non which it was based. Moreover, the person concerned and his counsel were made aware of \nthe amendment to the report at the outset of the hearing. \n \nOn the other hand, it is important for officers to note that an A44(1) report cannot be amended \nat any point where further review reveals that the report contains a substantive error (e.g., \nwrong inadmissibility section under the IRPA). In addition, where further investigation leads to a \nfinding that the grounds cited in the report are not valid but the person falls within some other \ninadmissible class, or identifies an additional ground of inadmissibility which the officer intends \nto pursue, the officer must write a new A44(1) report for a fresh referral to the MD. In such \ncases, where a new A44(1) report is written to replace an existing report, officers must ensure \nthe previous examination case is cancelled in GCMS in accordance with required procedures, \nincluding the creation of any process notes where appropriate. Where substantive changes are \nmade to the A44(1) report, officers must also ensure that the new report is provided to the \nperson concerned in accordance with the procedural fairness requirements outlined in previous \nsections of these guidelines. \n \n14.5 Overview: Minister's opinions/interventions \n \nIdentification of cases where an opinion under A115(2) of the Minister of IRCC for \nprotected persons may be warranted  \n  \nInformation may come to the attention of an officer in the course of an investigation of a person \nwho is a protected person under A95(2) which the officer believes may warrant flagging the \ncase for a future request for a Minister’s opinion under A115(2) that a person is a danger to the \npublic in Canada, or should not be allowed to remain in Canada on the basis of the nature and \nseverity of acts committed or of danger to the security of Canada.   \n \nWhile such a request may not be made until the person has been found to be inadmissible \nunder A34, A35, A35.1, A36(1) or A37 and becomes the subject of a removal order that is in \nforce, officers at the A44(1) stage may flag the case for consideration for a future request for a \nMinister’s opinion in their recommendation to the MD, where appropriate. If a removal order is \nissued, the case can then be referred for consideration of a request for a Minister’s opinion in \naccordance with agency guidelines and local processes.  \n"

If an officer becomes aware of new information relative to any of the \ninadmissibility provisions under A34 through A37, or where there is information to suggest that \nthere is a substantive contradiction of any document or statement made by a refugee claimant, \nofficers should: \n \n \nconduct an interview and take notes (see section 11. 6,  ‘Procedure:  End of \nexamination for refugee claimants’;   \n \nseize any relevant documents under A140(1) that could be used as evidence; \n \nupdate the National Case Management System (NCMS) to indicate that the case is \nunder investigation and the reason(s) for the investigation; \n \ncontact the appropriate Hearings unit to discuss case details; \n \nat the request of the Hearings Officer or Hearings Advisor, conduct a further \ninvestigation to collect additional evidence; \n \nwhen the investigation is complete, transfer the file and all supporting documentation \nto the Hearings Officer or Hearings Advisor with a memorandum outlining the case \ndetails. \n \nNote: following a decision of the RPD that refugee protection has ceased under A108(2), the \nMinister may not simply rely on a previous removal order (issued against the person before \nprotected person status was granted) to remove that person.

In circumstances where an officer believes that previously imposed conditions by the ID are \nno longer required or are insufficient to ensure compliance, but may not necessarily require that \nthe person be re-arrested first, officers will refer the file to the appropriate Hearings unit, \narticulating the need to amend the existing conditions and request that a Hearings Officer make \na request to the ID to vary the order.  \n"
