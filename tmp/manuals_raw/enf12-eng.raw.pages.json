Officers (e.g. \nBorder Services Officers) with mandates to enforce more than one Act of Parliament at the same \ntime (e.g. during a POE examination) must ensure that they clearly know and understand which \nAct they are administering and/or enforcing as well as which authority they are relying upon.  \n2. \nProgram objectives \nThe objectives of Canada’s immigration program concerning search, seizure, fingerprinting and \nphotographing are: \n \nTo protect public health and safety and to maintain the security of Canadian society; \n \nTo promote international justice and security by denying access to Canadian territory to \npersons who are criminals or security risks; and \n \nTo facilitate the entry of visitors, students and temporary workers for processes such as \ntrade, commerce, tourism, international understanding and cultural, educational and \nscientific activities. \nThe authorities to search, seize, fingerprint and photograph permit officers to: \n \nconfirm the identity of persons seeking entry to Canada;  \n \nensure compliance with the Act and Regulations; \n \nseize and hold any means of transportation, document, or other thing that may be used \nfor enforcing the Act and the Regulations, including evidence for prosecutions; \n \nprevent the misuse of documents that were fraudulently or improperly obtained; \n \nreturn and disposing of seized things; \n \ncollect biometric information from a foreign national. \n3. \nThe Act, Regulations and Designation & Delegation of Authority \nThe following legislative authorities for an officer to search, seize, take fingerprints and \nphotographs  are found in the IRPA and IRPR. Authorities may vary between POE and Inland and \nalso between CBSA and IRCC officials. \nThese provisions represent general enabling authorities. As such, officers must ensure that they \nare applied in the proper circumstances and by the appropriate individuals. Both the CBSA and \nIRCC IRPA Designation and Delegation Instruments should be consulted in order to determine \nthat an officer is granted the authority to exercise the provisions in question.  \nPursuant to subsection 6(1) of the IRPA, both the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency \nPreparedness (PS) and the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada have the \nauthority to designate any persons or class of persons to carry out any purpose of any provision \n"

This is referred to \nas delegation of authority. \nThe Designation of Officers and Delegation of Authority instrument stipulates who has the \nauthority to perform specific immigration related functions. There are two Designation and \nDelegation Instruments (D&D). One is made by IRCC and the other by CBSA. In each Instrument, \nIRCC and CBSA designate and delegate authorities to their own officials based on listed job title, \nas well as to officials in the other departments. This is referred to as cross-designations and \ncross-delegations.

The CBSA facilitates the entry of genuine travellers who \ncomply with the legislation while restricting the access of travellers who are in non-compliance or \nhave not satisfactorily established their identity. \nTo achieve program objectives, the CBSA may search persons seeking entry into Canada in \norder to confirm their identity and ensure compliance with the Act. Officials may also seize \ndocuments or other things in order to prevent their fraudulent or improper use or to carry out the \npurposes of the Act.  \nFurthermore, fingerprints and photographs may be taken to ensure effective identity management \nand risk assessment, which are critical in combating fraud, managing the movement of people \nand protecting Canada’s security interests. \nOfficers are to support the objectives of the IRPA while ensuring that all decisions taken under the \nAct are consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom (Charter). \n \n5. Legislative provisions \n5.1 Charter rights respecting search or seizure \nThe Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter) protects the basic rights of all persons in \nCanada, including foreign nationals. Sections 8 through 10 of the Charter govern an officer’s \nauthority to conduct searches and seizure. \n5.2 Protection against unreasonable search or seizure \nSection 8 of the Charter provides that everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable \nsearch or seizure.  As such, officers can only search and seize in the course of their duties in a \nmanner that meets this obligation under the Charter. Therefore, before conducting a search under \nthe IRPA, an officer must establish that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a person \nseeking entry to Canada has not revealed their identity, has hidden documents relevant to their \nadmissibility, or has concealed documents that may be used in the commission of an offence of \nsmuggling or trafficking persons or for contraventions under the Act and Regulations. \n \n5.3 Right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned \nSection 9 of the Charter provides that everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or \nimprisoned.

It is not \nexcepted that a disrobement search should often be required in the context of s. 139 IRPA \nsearch. \n5.4 Right to counsel when search constitutes detention \nSection 10 of the Charter requires that all persons being arrested or detained (including persons \nwho are submitting to any type of involuntary personal search) be advised of the reason for the \ndetention and of their right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. \nOfficers must ensure that the person understands why a search is being conducted and \nnecessary. Officers must take reasonable steps to provide an interpreter or other suitable person \ncapable of speaking the language of the person when a language barrier is identified. Officers \nmust also be mindful that the person appreciates the nature of what is taking place when dealing \nwith vulnerable persons which include but are not limited to individuals with health, mental health \nor addiction issues, the elderly, minors and victims of trafficking.  \nA personal (disrobement) search effectively places a person under detention. As such, the person \nmust be advised of their rights and given an opportunity to contact counsel. Officers should \nprovide a reasonable amount of time for the person to talk to a lawyer to obtain legal advice about \ntheir situation and must provide them with information on what legal aid services are available in \nthe area. \n5.5  Solicitor-client privilege: Lavallee1 Supreme Court Decision \nThe Supreme Court of Canada ruled in Lavallee that the confidentiality of communication \nbetween a lawyer and their client(s), in the context of search and seizure, is protected. On the \nrare occasion when an officer is faced with a solicitor-client privilege scenario, where the officer is \nin possession of a document that may give rise to solicitor-client privilege, an officer will need to  \nrefrain from infringing on that right.  \nIn order for solicitor-client privilege to apply, the following conditions must be met:  \n1. there must be a communication between a client (or their agent) and a legal advisor; \n2. this communication entails the seeking or giving of legal advice; and \n3. this communication is intended by the parties to be confidential. \nThere is an exception to solicitor-client privilege, namely when the client seeks guidance from a \nlawyer in order to facilitate the commission of fraud or crime. An exception also exists where \ncommunication is not intended to be confidential. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised \nbefore examining or seizing documents that could be subject to solicitor-client privilege. Officers \nshould consult with their manager first, then seek further assistance from CBSA Case \nManagement HQ, if needed. \nThe officer should evaluate whether the examination of the document is necessary for the \npurposes of the IRPA and remain cognizant of the possibility that the documents may be subject \nto solicitor-client privilege. For example, if enough evidence exists to support an inadmissibility \nallegation or there are sufficient identity and travel documents to effect removal, then search and \nseizure of the document in question may not be necessary. Furthermore, if subject to solicitor-\nclient privilege, officers will need to ensure not to infringe upon that right. It is not expected that \nofficers will have to deal with a large volume of documents that could be subject to solicitor-client \nprivilege. Moreover, in the mail examination context, procedures put in place to protect any \n                                                        \n1 Lavallee, Rackel & Heintz v.

Procedure: Searches \n6.1 Authority and Reasonable Grounds to Search \nThe authority to conduct a search of a person and their luggage, personal effects and the means \nof transportation that conveyed the person to Canada at a port of entry (POE) comes from  \nA139(1), which requires that an officer must believe on reasonable grounds that the person \nseeking to come into Canada:  \n \nhas not revealed their identity;  \n \nhas hidden on or about their person documents that are relevant to their admissibility; or  \n \nhas concealed documents that may be or have been used for the purpose of smuggling or \ntrafficking of persons into Canada or for other contraventions under the Act and Regulations.   \nCase law has established that “reasonable grounds” is greater than mere suspicion or conjecture \nbut less than the balance of probabilities. Reasonable grounds are grounds that, due to certain \nelements, facts, circumstances or available information, would lead an informed and experienced \nofficer to believe that a violation of the IRPA or its Regulations may have occurred, are occurring \nor may occur.  \nFor example, an officer may believe that an undocumented refugee claimant, who is under \nexamination, had a travel document when boarding the aircraft, as it would have been required by \nthe airline. This circumstance may constitute reasonable grounds to do a baggage search and a \npersonal (frisk) search. However, an officer who suspects that a foreign national, seeking entry to \nCanada as a temporary resident, intends to work without authorization – even though the foreign \nnational has given consistent answers to the officer's questions – does not have reasonable \ngrounds to conduct a baggage or personal search. In this instance, mere suspicion does not \nconstitute reasonable grounds. The officer would require other grounds to support a search, such \nas a past history of untruthfulness or working without authorization and some indication that an \nimmigration violation will occur. Officers must always document what led them to believe that a \nsearch was necessary.  \nNOTE: A139(1) only applies when an individual is seeking to come into Canada. Therefore, \nit does not authorize officers to conduct searches in Canada in the absence of evidence \nthe person is seeking entry (e.g. inland). This includes refugee claimants who were \nauthorized to proceed in Canada for further examination pursuant to A23. Please refer to \nsection 6.7 for additional details. \n6.2 Types of search pursuant to 139(1) of the IRPA \nCBSA officers are authorized to search any person seeking to come into Canada (POE) as per  \nsubsection 139(1) of the IRPA. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that officers are able to \nconduct a search when they have reasonable grounds to believe that the person seeking entry \nmay not be providing their genuine identity, has hidden documents relevant to their admissibility, \nhas committed a contravention of the IRPA, or possesses documents that may be used in the \ncommission of any contravention of the IRPA.  \nThere are two types of search that an officer may pursue: a Preliminary Search and a Personal \nSearch. \n"

This examination is for the purpose of detecting documents or evidence \nthat relate to identity, admissibility and offences under the Act. For the examination of digital \ndevices, please refer to section 6.15 – Examination of Digital Devices at the Port of Entry and in \nthe Inland Enforcement Context. \nAn officer may ask the individual undergoing a preliminary search to empty their pockets and to \nremove a coat or jacket for examination. This type of search does not involve physical contact \nwith the individual. \n \nType of \nsearch \nExplanation \nPreliminary \nSearch \nPreliminary \nSearch  \nAn officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that a person is \nseeking to enter Canada and may have documents relevant to identity \nor to admissibility hidden on them, in their luggage and/or conveyance \nor that were or may be used in the commission of an offence, may \nconduct a preliminary search. A preliminary search is conducted on a \nperson’s luggage and personal belongings. This search may extend to \nthe traveller’s means of transportation or checked baggage.  \nPreliminary searches may also involve the search of the outer layers \nof clothing of a person. When searching the outer layers of clothing, \nofficers may ask the person to empty their pockets and may search \nthe outermost layer of clothing to ensure that the pockets are empty \nand that no additional pockets exist. Officers may also ask the person \nto remove the outer layer of clothing. Outer layers of clothing include \nitems that when removed, could not reasonably be expected to \nexpose the person in a manner considered inappropriate.These \nsearches are part of a routine processing and do not raise any \nCharter concerns \nPlease note that a search of the outer layers of clothing and a \nfrisk search done for officer safety are not the same and they \neach have their own purpose and legal authorizations. \nNo concurrence from a supervisor is required unless the search \ninvolves a minor child (see section immediately following this table). \nPersonal \nSearch \nFrisk Search \ninvolving \nphysical \ncontact \nA frisk search involving physical contact with the person in order to \nfind documents hidden on or around their body is considered to be \npart of a personal search and therefore the person must be under \narrest or detention. \nPlease note that this is different from a frisk search done for \nofficer safety. \nApproval from a supervisor is required for a frisk search to be \nconducted under 139(1) of the IRPA.  \nDisrobement \nsearch \nA disrobement search involves the full or partial disrobement of a \nperson to detect or obtain documents or other evidence that the \nperson has concealed on their person.

This search requires the approval \nfrom a supervisor, in all cases. \n \n6.3 Minor Children  \nSpecial consideration must be applied when dealing with minors, particularly in the case of \nunaccompanied minors. An officer does not require approval from a supervisor to conduct a \npreliminary search unless the search involves a minor child. An officer conducting a search \ninvolving a minor child must demonstrate particular sensitivity for the emotional well-being of the \nchild. The parent or adult accompanying the child should be present during the search. An officer \nmust ensure that another officer is present throughout the duration of the search as the witness \nand the activity should be well documented. \n \nNote: If, when conducting a search, officers suspect that there may be a risk to the welfare of a \nminor child, whether the child is unaccompanied or not, provincial child protection authorities \nshould be contacted. If a local child protection agency declines to become involved, officers \nshould request this be put in writing and sent to them. All interactions with the child protection \nagency should be recorded in the officer notebook. Officers should also be alert to situations \nwhere it is possible that a child has been trafficked, smuggled or abducted.If they encounter \nsuch situations, officers should consult ENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited \nChildren, CBSA Enforcement (EN) manual, Part 2, Chapter 15 Trafficking in Persons as well \nas IRCC’s Program Delivery Instructions for victims of trafficking in persons. \n \n6.4 Search related to an offence under IRPA \nPursuant to A139(1)(b), a CBSA officer may search any person seeking to enter Canada, \nincluding Canadian citizens, if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the person has \ncommitted, or possesses documents that may be used in the commission of, an offence referred \nto in sections A117, A118 or A122. Since criminal charges may follow, officers should contact \nCBSA Criminal Investigations from the outset. \n \nBefore searching or questioning any person about possible violations of the IRPA where charges \nmay be laid, the officer must inform the person of their rights under section 10 of the Charter. If \nthe officer questions the person concerning immigration offences (sections 117 to 137 of IRPA), \nany information obtained before the person is informed of their Charter rights may be inadmissible \nas evidence in subsequent prosecutions against the person. \n \nHowever, Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and persons registered as Indians under the \nIndian Act have the right to enter Canada if following an examination on their entry an officer is \nsatisfied that the person is a citizen, permanent resident,or person registered as an Indian.  \nTherefore, once an officer establishes that a person is Canadian, permanent resident or a person \nregistered as an Indian, the officer must end the examination and authorize the person to enter \nCanada.   \n \nIn the case of Canadian citizens, permanent residents or persons registered as Indians, any delay \nin authorizing entry to Canada, including a personal search in the form of a disrobement search, \nconducted for immigration purposes, may constitute detention and the person would have to be \nadvised of their right to counsel.  \n \nIn the case where a group is travelling together and travellers have different immigration status \n(e.g. Foreign National, Permanent Resident, Canadian Citizen), and an officer has determined \n"

Concerns related to one \nmember of the group do not authorize the search of other members of the group in order to \nsearch for evidence related to first traveller in question. \n \n6.5 Officer safety in conducting searches \nAn officer should never assume that a person, including one that is detained, has been searched. \nOfficer and public safety requires that search procedures be carefully observed and that \nappropriate documentation be completed in full. When custody of a detained person is being \ntransferred from one officer or agency to another, search guidelines and clear communication are \nof critical importance. However, officers should be cognizant that the authority to search does not \nimpose a duty to search. If an officer believes that they can conduct their work safely without \nconducting another search, for instance in cases where the custody of a person is transferred and \nthe officer is satisfied that the person has been searched and the search has been documented, \nthey may decide that no further search is necessary. \nThe safety of the general public, as well as the officer’s own personal safety, are of the utmost \nimportance and caution should be exercised at all times when conducting a search.  \n6.6 General search procedures \nIt is imperative that officers make notes of all details of any examination that leads to a \npreliminary or personal search, as well as the items found during the search. Officers may be \ncalled on to testify in court as to the reasonable grounds for the search. A second officer should \nwitness the search and both officers should initial each evidence bag or container in which the \nseized items are held. This practice will assist in ensuring officer safety, as well as providing a \nwitness in the event that allegations of impropriety are made against the officer. It may also assist \nin establishing the continuity of evidence.  \nAny information relevant to conducting a search must be recorded in the officer’s notebook [BSF \n556] and in the client's file. Officers are required to keep a written record of each personal search \nconducted. All relevant information, including anything out of the ordinary that occurs and any \ncomments made by the client, should be noted.  More information about note-taking procedures \nmay be found in ENF 7 Immigration Investigations and IRPA s.55 Arrests/Detention. \nOfficers conducting a search must maintain a professional demeanour and refrain from \nresponding to profanity or abuse. Profane or abusive language directed at an officer is not a \nground for arrest but may constitute a ground for an obstruction charge. Prior to arresting for \nobstruction (criminal offence), an officer should consult with Criminal Investigations.    \nIn addition, the following guidelines must be observed in every search situation:  \n \nThe person being searched shall not be left alone until the search is completed; \n \nThe person’s belongings, particularly money and other valuables, should not be left \nunattended until the search is completed and the belongings have been secured; \n \nThe person being searched shall first be asked to identify their goods or baggage and to \nconfirm ownership. This will enable an officer to establish possession, should they find \ndocuments; \n \nThe search of an individual's personal effects shall be conducted in a closed office or other \narea out of sight of the general public, but in the presence of the individual;  \n"

This will help to alleviate some of the person’s anxiety and help to \nprevent the heightening of tension or escalation of uncooperative or violent behaviour;  \n \nUnnecessary conversation, personal remarks and humour are to be carefully avoided by \nofficers conducting the search. Officers should be considerate of the fact that this is a serious \nmatter and stressful for the person who is being searched; \n \nA Search form (BSF899) must be completed in all cases at a POE and should be scanned \nand uploaded to GCMS to the ‘Clients’ screen at the following path: Clients>Documents>ID \nSupporting documents sub tab. Then select type: CDN Immigration Doc, sub-type: Client \nSubmission and document #: (BSF899).  \n6.7 Conducting Preliminary and Full Examination Searches at Ports of Entry \nPursuant to A139(1), officers may search any person seeking to come into Canada. However, \nofficers should be aware that there are different circumstances in which a person is considered to \nbe seeking entry. Subsection 27(2) of the IRPR states that “a person who seeks to enter Canada \nat a place other than a port of entry must appear without delay for examination at the port of entry \nthat is nearest to that place.”  \nTherefore, in order to rely on POE examination provisions and related authorities, such as \nA139(1), officers will need to articulate that there is a geographic and temporal proximity to the \nborder if, for example, a person crosses the border between ports of entry but is intercepted \nwithin a geographic and temporal proximity of the border and brought to a POE for an \nexamination. This should be reflected in officer notes in GCMS and in the client’s file. \nSearches pursuant to subsection A139(1) are linked to the fact that the person crossed \ninternational borders, and as such they have a lower expectation of privacy. The BSO conducting \nthe initial examination, before deciding if authorizing entry under A23 is warranted, may perform a \nsearch if they feel it is necessary. However, once a person has been authorized to enter Canada \nunder A23 and presents themselves at a CBSA office, the officer cannot be reasonably certain \nthat the person will have in their possession the same documents to support a determination of \nadmissibility or eligibility, personal digital devices, or other items they had with them upon entry. \nThe person is still under examination and the officer may ask or require certain information \npursuant to section A16, however this does not equate to a search under A139. \nAll searches are to be conducted in a courteous and professional manner in accordance with the \nCBSA Code of Conduct. \nWhen conducting a preliminary or full examination search at a POE, an officer should:  \n \ntake measures to ensure their own health and safety as well as that of fellow officers and the \npublic; \n \ncomplete the applicable section of the Search form [BSF899];  \n \nexplain to the person why their baggage or vehicle is being searched;  \n \narrange an interview if the person requests permission to speak to a supervisor; \n \nmake detailed notes in their notebook of any articles relating to immigration that are found; \n \nconfirm ownership of all baggage by asking the following questions: \n Is this your bag?  \n"

Therefore,it is not enough that the luggage is at the POE.  \nA139(1) only authorizes officers to conduct a search under IRPA, not for Customs Act or other \nreasons. \nOfficers will find it easier to search carry-on luggage if they develop a systematic approach. \nOfficers should wear kevlar or other protective gloves for personal safety.  \nOnce a search has begun, the person whose belongings are being searched must never be left \nalone. \n6.9 Conducting personal searches  \nPersonal searches include frisk and disrobement searches. Because these searches involve \nphysical contact, they are of a more sensitive nature. When searching persons under IRPA, \nofficers will encounter cases requiring sensitivity and careful considerations, such as when they \nare dealing with vulnerable persons. \n \nSearching vulnerable persons \nWhen conducting personal searches pursuant to subsection 139(1) of IRPA, it is important for \nofficers to identify vulnerable persons at the earliest opportunity in order to ensure that \nappropriate considerations are factored into decisions and/or any actions taken during the search. \nThe following are some examples of persons who may be identified as vulnerable: \n \nminors (under the age of 18)/ unaccompanied minors; \n \nelderly persons; \n \nindividuals with severe medical conditions or physical disabilities; \n \npregnant persons and nursing mothers; \n \npersons with a suspected or known mental illness (includes suicidal persons and persons \nwho self-harm); \n \nvictims/suspected victims of human trafficking or family related violence. \nOther persons may display less obvious symptoms of a vulnerability, which may not become \napparent until the person is searched: \n \nvictims of gender-based violence may become distressed during a personal search. They \nmay also show signs of distress at the prospect of being searched by an officer of a \ndifferent gender; \n \nvictims of trauma may have difficulty coping with the search because it is performed by \npersons in uniform or because they are confined in a closed room with officers. \n \nPersonal searches \n"

Do you understand? \n \nYou have the right to retain and instruct counsel of your choice, in private and without \ndelay. You have the right to free and immediate legal advice from duty counsel. Duty \ncounsel is available at _____: during the following hours: _____ . You have the right to \napply for legal assistance without charge through the Provincial Legal Aid program. The \nLegal Aid telephone number in this area is: _____. Their office is located at: _____ and \noffice hours are from ______. Do you understand? Do you wish to call a lawyer now? \n \nYou need not say anything. You have nothing to hope from any promise or favour, or \nnothing to fear from any threat, whether or not you do say anything. Anything you do say \nmay be used in evidence. Do you understand?” \n \nA139(2) requires that a search of a person seeking to come into Canada be performed by a \nperson of the same sex as the person being searched. If an officer of the same sex is not \navailable, any suitable person of the same sex may be authorized by an officer to perform the \nsearch. Officers should be aware that other considerations may arise, specifically in the context of \ngender diversity, which includes all transgender, gender-fluid, non-binary, two-spirit, cisgender, \nand other gender identities. Please consult the Internationally recognized sexual orientation or \ngender identity of expression (SOGIE) definitions for additional information. \nShould a situation arise where a personal search is required on a person who self identifies as \ngender diverse, the CBSA must provide the individual with a choice of the sex of the officer who \nwill conduct the personal search. The options that will be available to the individual are: \nA. Male officers only; \nB. Female officers only; or \nC. A split search. \nAlthough these options are specific to a person seeking entry into Canada, and mandated by \nIRPA, they are principles that should be applied in the Inland context (search incidental to arrest) \nwhenever possible.  \nA split search is conducted by two sets of officers, the first set completes the search of the upper \nbody while leaving the lower body clothed. The individual is then permitted to fully dress, and is \nturned over to a second set of officers of the opposite sex to conduct the search of the lower \nbody, while the upper body remains clothed. The individual being searched will be fully observed \nat all times during the turnover from the first set of officers to the second set of officers to ensure \nthat continuity of any potential evidence is maintained throughout the search process. \n"

This includes being \nsensitive to gender-related issues when speaking to the person, and being careful to use gender \nterms that reflect the person’s gender identification or gender-neutral terms when referring to the \nperson in documents/notes or completing IRPA forms. \nAn officer should commence a personal search by: \n \nexplaining the reason for the search to the person concerned; \n \nexplaining, if challenged, the legal authority under A139(1) for the officer to conduct the \nsearch; and \n \nmaking arrangements, where the person is detained and wishes to exercise their rights under \nthe Charter, for access to a telephone and to a telephone directory.

This will help prevent claims of theft. If the person claims to be missing items, the \nofficer should review the search form with the person to determine what is missing and \nattempt to resolve the situation; and \n \nin cases where an officer discovers illicit contraband, such as weapons or drugs, they will \nimmediately arrest, advise and caution the person. For more information related to the \ndiscovery of illicit contraband at the POE, refer to CBSA Enforcement Manual – Part 6. \n6.11. Conducting disrobement searches  \nConducting a disrobement search while officers are enforcing the IRPA would only occur under \nexceptional circumstances. An officer must obtain a supervisor’s approval prior to conducting a \ndisrobement search. The purpose of a search under IRPA is to locate documents; consequently, \nit will be extremely rare that a person will hide documentary evidence in a location that would \nrequire disrobement. \nThere may be a situation where, as a result of the frisk search, it may be necessary to have the \nperson disrobe so that an officer can search for or remove evidence.  \nA disrobement search consitutes a detention. As such, prior to commencing the search, an officer \nmust advise the person of their rights under the Charter, specifically the right to retain and instruct \ncounsel, and must give the person a reasonable opportunity to exercise those rights. The grounds \nfor the detention should be fully explained to the person. Once the person has had an opportunity \nto contact counsel, the search can proceed. It is not necessary to delay a search until the arrival \nof counsel.  \nImmediately after an officer advises the person of their Charter rights, or as a simultaneous \naction, but before the person enters the search room or has access to a telephone, the person \nshould be frisked for weapons. This frisk is a precaution to ensure the safety of the officer and all \npersons in the inspection area and is not meant to discover evidence. An officer may use a metal-\ndetector wand if one is available.  \nOfficers must ensure that disrobement searches are properly documented, including notes to be \nkept on file. Resultant disrobement searches will also require proper documentation of any \nassociated seizures.  \n6.12. Conducting a search of a means of transportation  \nPursuant to A139(1), an officer may search a means of transportation that conveyed the person \nto Canada. In order for an officer at the POE to conduct a lawful search of a conveyance, there \nneeds to be reasonable grounds to believe there are documents which reveal the person’s \nidentity, are relevant to their admissibility, or may be used in the commission of an offence, \nnamely human smuggling, trafficking or to otherwise contravene the IRPA. \nDocuments and papers that are in a vehicle or are in the occupants’ possession may offer clues \nregarding other parties who have a legal interest in a means of transportation. Those documents \nshould be examined and if necessary, may be copied. In the event that a means of transportation \n"

Although there is nothing in the wording of A15(3) limiting this authority to the \nPOE, however, in order to rely on this provision to conduct a search, there must be some \ntemporal and geographic connection to the POE. For example, if there is evidence that a \nconveyance was used to bring individuals into Canada, such as law enforcement agency \nobserving this take place or it being captured on video, an officer with delegated authority under \nA15(3) could inspect the conveyance in the context described above. However, even if it is \nbelieved that a conveyance was used to transport persons into Canada, it may be difficult to \njustify the use of this provision some distance from the border. \n6.13  \nRemoval of the contents of a means of transportation \nAn officer should ensure that any items of monetary or potentially sentimental value in a seized \nmeans of transportation are removed and returned to the transporter. While a seized means of \ntransportation should not be stripped of all of its contents, officers should remove items to limit the \nAgency’s liability. It may be prudent for the officer to allow the transporter to witness the search. If \nthat person is disruptive or unruly, the officer should have another officer nearby to witness any \nitems removed.  \nAn officer should record or document items removed from the means of transportation and \nreturned to the transporter, and should get that individual’s signed acknowledgement that they \nhave received the items. This may alleviate possible allegations of impropriety on the part of the \nofficer. \n6.14 \nCompleting the Search form BSF899 \nThe BSF899 is meant to ensure national consistency when documenting searches conducted \nunder subsection 139(1) of the IRPA. Officers must complete the appropriate section(s) of the \nBSF899 in the following circumstances: \n \n1. Preliminary searches and full examination searches that are resultant require that the BSF899 \nbe completed. If a preliminary search and/or full examination is non-resultant, the BSF899 is not \nrequired and a record of such a search in an officer’s notebook is sufficient.  \n2. Personal searches, whether a frisk search or disrobement require that the BSF899 be \ncompleted in addition to any record in an officer’s notebook.  \nWhen completing the BSF899, it is important to ensure the following:  \nFully complete the top portion of the form labelled “Traveller identification”.   \nPart A – Search: This section must be completed in all instances where the BSF899 is being \ncompleted.  \n \nNote: In the case of non-resultant preliminary searches that do not require the completion \nof the BSF899, officers must still ensure: \n \nthat the person being searched is informed of the authority to search found in \nsubsection 139(1) of the IRPA; \n \nthat the person being searched is informed of the reasonable grounds for the search; \n \nthe times that the search commenced and ended are documented in the officer’s \nnotes; and \n"

For procedures related to the examination of digital devices for the administration and \nenforcement of the IRPA at a Port of Entry, please refer to the CBSA Policy on Port of Entry \nExaminations of Travellers' Digital Devices (Enforcement Manual (EN) Part 4, Chapter 16) on \nAtlas.  \nInland Enforcement \nInland Enforcement Officers should not rely on A139(1) to examine digital devices since A139(1) \nonly allows for searches of persons seeking entry to Canada. \nA16(3) of the IRPA allows an officer to require or obtain evidence from a permanent resident or a \nforeign national who is arrested, detained, subject to an examination or subject to a removal \norder, any evidence - photographic, fingerprint or otherwise - that may be used to establish their \nidentity or compliance with the Act. That said, A16(3) should not be relied upon as an authority to \nconduct examinations of digital devices for inland investigative purposes. Furthermore, Inland \nEnforcement Officers cannot rely on Criminal Code of Canada warrants to search digital devices \nand gather evidence for inland investigations.  \nOfficers may examine digital devices only if they obtain the person concerned’s written valid \nconsent (i.e. informed and voluntary). The person’s written consent must be obtained and \nrecorded on the BSF 835 form. Officers may, with the foreign national’s or permanent resident’s \nvalid consent, examine a digital device in support of the administration and enforcement of the \nIRPA for Inland Enforcement purposes. For additional information on the examination of digital \ndevices in the Inland Enforcement context and valid consent, please refer to section 19.18 – \nSearching an arrested person of ENF 7. \n \n"

Additional Types of Search  \n7.1 Search incidental to arrest \nIn common law, a peace officer may carry out a search of a person who has been lawfully \narrested. The existence of reasonable grounds is not a prerequisite to the existence of such a \npower. \nThe courts have ruled that when conducting a search of an arrested person a peace officer is \nauthorized to remove from that person any of the following three types of items:  \n \nweapons or implements that might assist in the person's escape;  \n \nanything with which a person might injure themselves or others; or \n \nanything that can be considered as evidence of the offence for which the person has been \narrested.  \nIn the Supreme Court of Canada decisions Cloutier v. Langlois, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 158  and R. v. \nCaslake, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, precedents for searches incidental to arrest were established. In \nthese decisions, the Supreme Court held that a search is constitutional if conducted without the \nuse of excessive force or constraint and for some valid purpose connected to the arrest, namely: \n \nto ensure the safety of the arresting officers; or \n \nto protect evidence from destruction at the hands of the person under arrest.  \nThe authority to arrest and detain compels a detained person to comply with a search by an \nofficer exercising that authority. Search incidental to arrest applies only to things in the \npossession or immediate surroundings of the person arrested. Immediate surroundings may be \nsearched for the purposes previously listed. Because the jurisprudence that establishes the \nprinciple of search incidental to arrest is related to criminal cases and because arrests under A55 \nare not made in connection with a criminal offence, any searches of the location in which the \nindividual was arrested for the purpose of seeking evidence of an IRPA inadmissibility or a travel \ndocument may be held unreasonable and not in compliance of section 8 of the Charter. \nThe power to search incidental to arrest is a discretionary one and need not be exercised where \nthe peace officer is satisfied that the law can be effectively and safely applied in its absence. \nNote: Searches conducted in the inland enforcement context can only be conducted incidental to \narrest. The authority to search incidental to arrest is governed by common law. The authority to \nsearch under A139(1) cannot be relied upon in the inland enforcement context to conduct \nsearches. \n7.2 Conducting a Frisk Search Incidental to Arrest  \nWhen a designated CBSA officer has completed an IRPA arrest and detention of an individual, \nwhich includes informing the individual of their Charter rights to speak with counsel, as well as \ntheir rights under the Vienna Convention, the officer may conduct a frisk search of the person \nincidental to the arrest.    \n \nA search applies to anything in possession or within the immediate surroundings of the arrested \nperson. Three conditions must be satisfied in order for the search of the person to be justifiable: \n \n \nthe arrest must be lawful; \n \n"

The officer must provide written notice of any seizure and otherwise \nfollow the instructions as per section 8 of this chapter. \n7.3 Search warrants \nOutside of the authority to conduct searches incidental to arrest, inland enforcement officers are \nnot permitted to search for evidence of an offence. Although A138(1) provides that an officer has \nthe authority and powers of a peace officer – including those set out in sections 487 to 492.2 of \nthe Criminal Code (CC) to enforce the IRPA, the use of section 487 of the CC provisions is \nlimited, by its own wording, to situations where there are reasonable grounds to believe that there \nis evidence in the specific place named in the warrant which would relate to an offence (i.e. \ncriminal offence). Unlike section 43 of the Customs Act, the IRPA does not contain any \nprovisions for compelling the production of records for administrative or non-criminal enforcement \npurposes. \nInland Enforcement Officers cannot rely on CC search warrants or production orders without \nreasonable grounds to believe that evidence of a criminal offence will be found in that place. So \nwhile CC warrants can be used to investigate a criminal offence under IRPA, these warrants \ncannot be obtained for purposes other than obtaining evidence of a criminal offence. Therefore, \nofficers cannot rely on CC search warrants to gather evidence in support of an inadmissibility \nreport under A44(1). \n \nWhere a CBSA inland enforcement officer suspects a criminal offence under IRPA has occurred \nand evidence in the form of documents or information relating to the offence may be found in a \nspecific place, they should engage a CBSA criminal investigator. \nCriminal investigators will assess the case specifics and, if a criminal investigation and search \nwarrant/production order are warranted, will discuss with the referring officer. \nWhere it can be reasonably demonstrated that an IRPA criminal offence (pursuant to Part 3 – \nEnforcement of the IRPA) has occurred and that information at a specific place will afford \nevidence of that offence (potentially including information that may be used to locate an individual \nor a document), a search warrant or production order may be requested pursuant to s. 487 CC \nand s. 487.012, respectively. These search warrants must be prepared and obtained by CBSA \nCriminal Investigators, in the context of their investigation towards the laying of criminal charges. \n \n8. Procedure: Seizures \n8.1 Authority and grounds for seizure \nA140 provides the legislative authority to seize any means of transportation, documents or other \nthing if an officer believes on reasonable grounds that it was fraudulently or improperly obtained \nor used or that the seizure is necessary to prevent its fraudulent or improper use or to carry out \nthe purposes of the Act. Both IRCC and the CBSA officials are designated with the authority to \nseize documents and other things. However, only CBSA officers have been designated with the \nauthority to seize a means of transportation. \n"

A vehicle that is detained remains in the possession of the \ntransporter, however, when the vehicle is seized, the CBSA takes possession of the vehicle and \nbecomes liable for the costs of handling, maintaining and disposing of it. The vehicle is seized as \nsoon as an officer delivers the notice of seizure. The delegated authority to seize a vehicle under \nsubsection A148(2) can be found in the Instruments of Designation and Delegation. For additional \ninformation relating to seizures made under the authority of A148(2), refer to ENF 15.  \nIn the case of persons seeking entry in to Canada, A15(3) provides the legislative authority for an \nofficer to board and inspect any means of transportation bringing persons to Canada, examine \nany person carried by that means of transportation and any record or document respecting that \nperson, and to seize and remove the record or document to obtain copies or extracts and hold the \nmeans of transportation until the inspection and examination are completed.  \nLimitation period for seizures \nThere is no limitation period for seizures of things on the grounds that they were fraudulently or \nimproperly obtained or used. These seizures may occur as necessary when lawful and \nappropriate. \n8.2 Seizing documents  \nWhile the authority to seize under the IRPA will primarily be applicable to situations involving \nforeign nationals or permanent residents, this provision also applies to Canadian citizens if the \nconditions of A140(1) are met. In all cases, officers are required to articulate the grounds for the \nseizure.   \nIRCC officers who have reasonable grounds to believe that documents were fraudulently or \nimproperly obtained or used may seize those documents and if necessary, transfer custody to the \nCBSA for further examination and/or investigation. This includes seizure of identity, travel and/or \nother documents as evidence or to effect a removal, should an individual become subject to an \nenforceable removal order. Although it is not a Charter right, if a person from whom a thing has \nbeen seized wants to contact legal counsel, the officer should make every effort to facilitate this \nrequest if is reasonable to do so. This may be as simple as providing the individual with \nopportunity and means to make a telephone call. Officers should record in their notebook whether \nthe person contacted legal counsel. \nFollowing a seizure made by an officer pursuant to A140(1), the officer is required by R253(1) to \nmake reasonable efforts: \n(1) to identify the lawful owner of thing seized; and \n(2) to give the lawful owner written notice of and reasons for the seizure \nFor travel documents, the notice of seizure given to the bearer should be sufficent to allow the \nofficers to fulfill their obligations under R253(1) without having to notify the issuing country. \nOfficers seizing travel and/or identity documents as well as other things (e.g. ticket stubs, \nemployment information, conveyances, etc.) must document the seizure on the  Notice of \nSeizure of (a) Travel and/or Identity Document(s) and/or Other Thing(s) [BSF 698] and to \ninclude the reasons for the seizure as well as information on how/where individuals may make an \nApplication for the Return of (a) Seized Travel and/or Identity Document(s) and/or Other \nThing(s) [BSF 699].   \n"

The officer should evaluate \ninadmissibility and consider addtional enforcement options such as arrest and detention as \nappropriate, if they are not satisfied of the foreign national’s identity. The officer should also \nconsult with Criminal Investigations Division as the use of a fraudulent document is an offence \nunder the IRPA. The officer will provide a BSF698: Notice of Seizure of (a) Travel and/or Identity \nDocument(s) and/or Other Thing(s) to the individual. Officers may also refer the document to \nregional Document Analysis Units (DAUs) if appropriate. Please refer to section 8.7 for additional \ndetails on sending documents for analysis. \nScenario 3 \nA Permanent Resident is convicted in Canada of a serious offence and is reported by an officer \npursuant to A44(1). The report is referred to the Immigration Division for an admissibility hearing. \nThe officer concludes that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the seizure of the \npermanent resident’s passport is necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act as per A140(1).  \nIf a removal order is issued and becomes enforceable, CBSA requires the passport to enforce the \nremoval order. The officer may provide a certified copy of the document in addition to the \nBSF698: Notice of Seizure of (a) Travel and/or Identity Document(s) and/or Other Thing(s). If, \nhowever, a referral for the admissibility hearing is later withdrawn or the PR is found not \ndescribed (i.e. no removal order is issued), officers must return the seized document. \n"

It is also possible that an individual is travelling with an \nEDL that they should be not be travelling with (e.g. ‘cancelled’). If this occurs, officers should \nadvise the individual(s) to attend the issuing authority of the EDL in order to resolve any \noutstanding issues. If an officer has any further concerns with regards to the EDL and its status, \nthey should investigate as necessary, including contacting the issuing authority in order to \ndetermine whether a seizure of the EDL is necessary and appropriate.

As such, officers should confirm with the provincial or territorial \nauthorities’ website if they have any doubts whether the EDLs are still valid for land and water \ntravel between Canada and the U.S. \n \n8.3 Seizing documents from refugee claimants \nAlthough IRPA does not require that all documents in possesion of refugee claimants be seized, \nIRCC and CBSA officers should always consider seizing all passports, pertinent identification and \ntravel documents carried by refugee claimants because the seizure may:  \n \nexpedite the identification of the person; \n \nassist in background checks; \n \nassist in identifying immediate family members; \n \nassist in verifying information provided in their Basis of Claim Form (BOC) \n \nensure compliance; \n \nensure that documents are not recycled; \n \nassist in removal should the refugee claim be unsuccessful. \nWhere a genuine document is seized, certified true copies will be provided to these individuals as \nthey may be required when seeking to access federal and provincial programs and services.  \nOther documents, such as a driver’s license, may also be seized if it meets the criteria of A140(1).  \nOfficers must make three copies of all documentation seized and provide a copy to the \nImmigration Refugee Board. Officers must complete a BSF698 and provide a copy to the \nclaimant.  \n8.4 Seizing documents abroad \nOfficers overseas may, following the examination of travel, identity and/or other document(s), \nhave reasonable grounds to believe that the document(s) was/were fraudulently or improperly \nobtained or used, or that the seizure is necessary to prevent a document’s fraudulent or improper \nuse or to carry out the purposes of the Act. \nHowever, Canadian officers may only enforce IRPA abroad to the extent that the host country has \nauthorized it. \nThe Vienna Conventions on Consular and Diplomatic relations impose an obligation on diplomats \nto respect the laws of the receiving state.  \nTherefore, CBSA officers may seize documents abroad only if the host country has agreed to \nallow Canada to exercise its legislative authority under subsection 140(1) of the IRPA within the \nhost’s territory. \nWhere officers overseas have the authority to seize documents, they may also seize documents \nthat are not issued by a Canadian authority. The approach to the question of seizure of \ndocuments will vary from location to location depending on the local environment in which the \nCBSA Liaison Officers (LO) and IRCC migration officers work, and the type of partnership or \narrangements they have with the local enforcement agencies, airlines and other foreign-based \nofficials with whom they interact. \n"

If the device is seized, officers should fill out the BSF698 form to record and \ndocument the seizure. \nDevices that are abandoned or found by officers may be returned to the US authorities under the \nStatement of Mutual Understanding guidelines only if the individual who had the device did \nnot make a claim for refugee status against the United States. In such cases, or for any other \ncases where advising the United States would not be appropriate officers may hold the device on \na BSF 241 – Non-Monetary General Receipt form. \n8.9 Seizing vehicles \nThe term “vehicle” is defined in the Regulations to include any means of transportation that may \nbe used for transportation by water, land or air. This can include cars, trucks, tractors, buses, \nmotorcycles, boats, airplanes and other modes of transportation. \nWhile A140(1) provides officers with the authority to seize a means of transportation, certain \nconditions must first be met.The officer must believe on reasonable grounds that the conveyance \nwas fraudulently or improperly used or that the seizure is necessary to prevent the fraudulent or \nimproper use or to carry out the purposes of the Act. For an officer to articulate the grounds to \nseize a means of transportation, there must be a logical purpose that is directly correlated with \nthe IRPA, such as an A44(1) report alleging an inadmissibility, an admissibility hearing, a removal \nor criminal charges. In other words, there needs to be an intention to pursue an enforcement \naction. \nCertain circumstances should occur for a seizure of a vehicle to be reasonable. In most cases a \nseizure of a conveyance will arise at a port of entry while carrying out the purposes of the Act.  \nOfficers should be aware that seizing a means of transportation in the inland enforcement context \nwill be rare and will typically happen when an offence has occurred that may lead to charges \nunder IRPA. Prior to the seizure of a vehicle in this situation, Criminal Investigations Division \nshould be consulted.         \nWhere the vehicle has more than one component (e.g., a car pulling a trailer), each is treated as \na separate vehicle. If they are seized, separate notices (BSF698 and reports) are required for \neach vehicle. In the following scenarios, it may be appropriate for a CBSA officer to consider \nseizing  a vehicle: \n \nWhere a vehicle is used to drop an undocumented, or otherwise inadmissible, person on the \nU.S. side of the border in order to assist the person in eluding examination, and/or picks up \nthe person on the Canadian side without the person appearing for examination. \n \nWhere the status of a person in the vehicle, who does not have a passport or a visa as \nrequired, is withheld or purposely misrepresented at a Port of Entry to prevent a proper \nexamination. However, BSOs should remember that not all misrepresentation will lead to a \nvehicle seizure. For instance, under section R22, persons who have claimed refugee \nprotection, if disposition of their claim is pending, and protected persons may be exempt from \n"

A vehicle seizure in those cases might not \nbe warranted.  \n \nWhere, during an examination, it is discovered that the driver of a vehicle allowed an \nundocumented person to exit the vehicle before the point of examination and that person \nwalked to the POE to report separately for an examination; and where it is established that \nthe driver was seeking entry to Canada but knowingly withheld documents and any \nconnection with the arrival of the pedestrian who is inadmissible.  \n \nWhere the driver or owner of a vehicle knowingly brings refugee claimants to the border and \nreceives remuneration for these services (lawyers, consultants, or others). \nIt may NOT be appropriate for a CBSA officer to seize a vehicle where the driver or owner \nknowingly brings refugee claimants to the border without receiving any remuneration for these \nservices (family members, friends, NGOs). Officers should consider all of the relevant information \nin each individual case and ultimately be mindful as to the purpose of any seizure and any \npotential enforcement action along the immigration enforcement continuum.  \nSince a vehicle may be seized after the fact, officers should immediately take note of the vehicle’s \nidentity numbers and markings in case it leaves without permission or the seizure cannot take \nplace because of danger. This information can subsequently be used to link the vehicle to a \nfraudulent or improper use if it is located at a later date. If the seizure cannot be completed, the \nofficer should report the incident to the CBSA Regional Office and to the CBSA Regional Director. \nThe matter should be turned over to the RCMP for investigation and appropriate action. \nNote: Only the CBSA is designated to seize a means of transportation under A140. \n8.10 Seizure of commercial vehicles \nSubsection A148(2) provides CBSA officers with the authority to detain, seize or forfeit a vehicle \nof a transporter that fails to comply with an obligation under IRPA. The delegated authority to \nseize a commercial vehicle under A148(2) is identified in the Designation of Officers and \nDelegation of Authority manual. \nFor additional information on the procedures relating to seizures of vehicles or assets of \ncommercial transporters pursuant to A148(2), refer to ENF 15, Obligations of Transporters.  \n8.11 Notice of seizure  \nThe provisions related to the notice of seizure require that written notification be provided to the \nperson from whom the thing was seized, and if this person is not the lawful owner, reasonable \nefforts must be made to identify and notify the lawful owner of the seizure. With regards to travel \nand identity documents, notification to the bearer of the document will likely be considered as a \nvalid notice of seizure pursuant to subsection 253(1) of the IRPR, without the need to notify the \ncountry of issuance. \nIf the person from whom a thing was seized is not the lawful owner, the officer should ask the \nperson from whom it was seized to identify the owner or owners and request that they complete a \ndeclaration. An officer should document the steps taken to determine ownership and notify the \nlawful owner and, where appropriate, may also consider completing a statutory declaration. \nIn the case of a seized means of transportation, the lawful owner could include:  \n \nthe registered owner who is not the person from whom the means of transportation is seized; \n \nthe firm that owns the vehicle that has been leased or rented. \n"

The investigative body must make a written request, which specifies the \npurpose and describes the information to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph 8(2)(e) of the \nPrivacy Act.  \nThere may be other situations where the release of information obtained as result of a seizure \nmay be authorized under the Access to Information Act and Privacy Act. The officer is \nencouraged to seek the advice of their regional Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) \ncoordinators before considering such options. \n \n9. Procedure: Mail and courier search and seizures under IRPA  \nSubsection 42(1) of the Canada Post Corporation Act states that all mail arriving in Canada from \na place outside Canada that contains or is suspected to contain anything the importation of which \nis prohibited, controlled or regulated under the Customs Act or any other Act of Parliament shall \nbe submitted to a customs officer. \nThe objective of mail searches and seizures is to take out of circulation counterfeit, altered and \nimproperly obtained travel and identity documents. Documents found in international mail may be \nrelevant to prosecutions or enforcement actions under the Immigration and Refugee Protection \nAct.  \nOfficers involved in examining, seizing and caring for items seized in mail and courier systems \nshould strive for minimal impairment of privacy and be mindful of the responsibilities inherent in \ntheir authority. Officers should not examine or seize mail on behalf of any other agency or \ndepartment, unless legally authorized to do so. \n9.1 CBSA inspection procedures for international mail \nInternational mail arrives in Canada from other countries by marine, rail, highway, and air modes \nof transportation. The mail is received at Canada Post processing facilities where it is sorted for \nmovement within Canada. International mail is then directed for CBSA processing to one of three \nCBSA mail centres, all located within Canada Post facilities in Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal.  \nThe CBSA reviews all classes of mail received from Canada Post to identify and segregate items \nthat require further examination. The review includes priority post, first class, registered and \nparcel mail.  \nFor complete information on conducting a postal examination, see CBSA Enforcement Manual \nPart 4 Chapter 12. \n9.2 CBSA inspection procedures for shipments in the Courier Low Value Shipment \nProgram \nDue to the high-volume, low-value nature of goods imported in the courier stream, the CBSA has \nstreamlined the reporting, release, and accounting procedures for certain courier shipments via \nthe Courier Low Value Shipments (CLVS) Program. According to these procedures, authorized \ncouriers are allowed to present a single Cargo Release List (CRL) documenting all low-value \n"

The single report, the CRL, must be submitted to the \nCBSA before the conveyance arrives in Canada within specified modal timeframes. \nFor further information pertaining to Courier Examinations, see CBSA Enforcement Manual Part 4 \nChapter 13. \n9.3 How mail seizures work \nWhen a CBSA officer examines a parcel containing suspicious documents or other documents or \nthings that might be subject to seizure under A140(1), the CBSA officer will generally detain the \nparcel until it can be examined further. When deciding whether there are reasonable grounds for \na seizure under A140(1), the officer must take into account the totality of the circumstances, \nincluding the following: \n \nWhether the information upon which the grounds for seizure are based is compelling? \n \nWhether the information is credible? \n \nWhether the information is corroborated? \n9.4 Responsibilities of CBSA officers with respect to mail seizures \nCBSA officers conducting mail seizures are responsible for the following: \n \ntreating every seized document and/or any other item seized as a potential piece of evidence. \nThe packaging itself may also constitute important evidence and is worthy of the same \nconsideration; \n \nmaintaining records of seizure, including officer notebooks, as they may ultimately be subject \nto scrutiny in court and/or other enforcement proceedings; \n \njustifying their actions in the examination and seizure of international mail in the event of a \nprosecution, enforcement measure, complaint, audit, investigation, or other review; \n \nnotifying the lawful owner of seized documents and disposing of them in accordance with the \nImmigration and Refugee Protection Act. \nWith respect to enforcement measures, the integrity of seizure procedures is paramount to \nensuring proper control, accounting and continuity of evidence. \n9.5 Documenting and tracking seizures \nOfficers at CBSA mail centres should document seizures pursuant to A140 on the BSF698 form. \nAccording to local procedures, the BSF698 and the seized items may be sent to the appropriate \ninland enforcement office for further processing, such as entering the seizure information in \nGCMS. Officers should forward the items seized and form to the inland enforcement office using \nregistered mail or Purolator. The tracking number and seizure information should be recorded \naccording to existing procedures. \nIt is imperative that officers maintain a detailed record of any seizure action taken. This \ninformation may be useful in the event of a complaint, litigation, prosecution or enforcement \naction. It may also be used as evidence in immigration proceedings, admissibility hearings, \nappeals and refugee hearings, or to enforce removal orders. \nWhere the examination site does not have computer equipment available for use by the officer, \nwork sheets and seizure forms should be completed manually.

The \ninformation concerning seizures must be maintained so that information can be retrieved quickly. \nAt a minimum, the information recorded in the case of a seizure should include the following: \n \nlawful owner (where it can be determined); \n \nperson from whom the document was seized; \n \ndate and time the package was referred by the initial CBSA officer for further inspection; \n \nthe referral information (e.g., log numbers, courier company labels); \n \ndate, time, and place where examination of the package commenced; \n \ndate, time, and place where examination of the package was completed; \n \nnumber of items in package; \n \ndescription of all items seized; \n \nname and address of consignor; \n \nname and address of consignee; \n \nwhether full or partial seizure; \n \nif a partial seizure, date/time/place package returned for customs processing; \n \ndetails of action taken as a result of seizure; \n \ndetails of any representations received; \n \nfinal disposition of items seized; and \n \nthe seizure control number. \n9.6 Security, storage, and labeling of items seized \nRigorous standards of control, including appropriate secure storage, labeling, and regular \nmonitoring of any seizure is mandatory. Seized items stored locally will be subject to normal file \ncontrol practices, including inventory, review and purging. Officers and support clerks should be \nable, at any time, to determine the location and responsible officer for any seized item. \nAppropriate receipts for transmittal of seized items must also be carefully maintained.  \nA copy of the BSF698 Notice of Seizure of (a) Travel and/or Identity Document(s) and/or Other \nThing(s) should be securely attached to the envelope used to store seized items and the seizure \nshould be recorded according to local procedures.  \n9.7 Split seizures \nSplitting seizures for any reason should generally be avoided. If a seizure consists of several \nitems, they should all be kept together in the original seizure envelope until final disposition. \nThere may be exceptions to this, such as where multiple documents are seized relating to several \n"

In this instance, the seized documents would be individually forwarded to the \nrespective case files. \nWhile seized items under IRPA should be documented on the BSF698 form, items seized \npursuant to the Customs Act should be recorded on the appropriate CBSA form. \n9.8 Partial seizures \nIn a partial seizure, one or more document or other thing may be seized under IRPA while the \nrest of the items in the parcel may be returned to the customs process. If one or more documents \nor things are removed, the remaining goods should be re-sealed in the package and the officer \ncan return them to the customs process. On release by a CBSA officer, the package may then be \nreturned to the course of post. Where a partial seizure occurs, notification should be provided as \nper the Regulations.  \n9.9 Notification of owner  \nThe Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations require that officers effecting a seizure, full \nor partial, of items from international mail must provide notification to the rightful owner in all \ncases.  \nIn cases where ownership of seized goods cannot be readily established, for example where the \nimporter's or exporter's full name and address cannot be determined from the labels or other \ninformation accompanying the seized goods, officers should make reasonable alternative efforts \nto identify the owner. Efforts to locate the owner and the results at each stage should be recorded \nin detail on the seizure file and local mail seizure administrative databases. Where an owner is \nidentified, written notification of mail seizures should be made using the BSF698. Brief grounds \nfor seizure specific to each item listed on the form should be included in the \"Reason and/or \ndetails\" portion.  \nIf the goods clearly constitute items such as blank identity documents or counterfeit passports, \nthe officer can conclude that there is no lawful owner. In some cases, state-issued documents \nsuch as passports should be returned to the issuing authority. Officers should not notify an \nissuing state in cases where a document was seized from a refugee claimant when such \nnotification would alert the country to the presence of the refugee claimant in Canada.  \n9.10 Returning items to the customs process \nWhere an officer does not establish reasonable grounds for seizure, the package should be \nreturned without delay to the customs inspection process. An imported package is considered to \nbe in the customs secondary process unless seized by a CBSA officer for immigration purposes.  \nThere is no requirement to record reasons in support of a decision to return a package to the \ncustoms process. A minimum of information should be recorded about released packages as may \nbe required for tracking the item, for measurement of workload or other legitimate administrative \npurpose. No photocopies, images, transcriptions or other record of the contents of such packages \nare to be retained. \n10. Procedure: Custody and Liability of Seized Things \n10.1 Custody of seized items \nR252 requires an officer who seizes a thing under A140(1) to place it without delay in the custody \nof the Department/Agency. IRCC and CBSA officers are designated to seize documents or other \nthings under A140 while only the CBSA is delegated to seize a means of transportation under \nA140.

Seized items should be stored in a protected \nholding area with restricted access. If the RCMP seizes anything under the Immigration and \nRefugee Protection Act, they are required to turn it over to a CBSA officer.   \nStorage of seized vehicles should be arranged locally in consultation with the regional CBSA \noffice when necessary. The storage area should afford reasonable protection against damages, \ntheft and accidents. \nIf a file transfer occurs between IRCC and the CBSA, custody of the seized document or other \nthing will also change from one organization to the other. Means of transportation will always \nremain in the custody of the CBSA. \n10.2 Protecting evidence  \nAn officer may be required to testify in court that a document or other item seized has remained \nunchanged since it came into their possession: in other words, that the continuity of evidence has \nbeen maintained. Whatever evidence comes into an officer's possession, the officer must note \nthe date, time and place on the case file and in a notebook.  \nTo maintain the continuity of evidence for the purposes of prosecution under the Immigration and \nRefugee Protection Act or the Criminal Code, officers must ensure that seized items are kept in a \nsecure area and handled by a minimum number of persons.  \nEvery effort should be made to preserve documentary evidence in the same condition as it was \ncollected. It is also strongly advised to keep direct handling of orginal documents to an absolute \nminimum (if they are to be repeatedly referred to they should be individually placed inside copy \nsafe sheet protectors or transparent sleeves.) \nAt no time should documentary evidence be placed beneath something on which writing can \noccur, such as on a desk or attached to a clipboard, etc. This will add indented impressions to the \ndouments, which may not only impact the examination of the document(s) but risk leaving \nindentations of sensitive Agency information. Evidence containers should be marked for \nidentification before the documentary evidence is placed inside to avoid the addition of indented \nimpressions. \nThe evidence shall not be folded, torn, stamped, hole-punched, stapled, marked or touched \nunnecessarily. Avoid using staples, tweezers, binder clips and other such devices on the \ndocuments. Furthermore, no additional writing should be added to the evidence for record \nkeeping purposes, the documents should not be fed through the automatic document feeder on a \nphotocopier. Copies should be made by manual placement of documents on the glass plate. \nThe officer should:  \n \nmake a photocopy of the document and stamp “certified true copy” on each page and write \ntheir initials, the time and the date;  \n \nwrite a description on the envelope of the contents, the name and file number of the person \nconcerned, the officer's initials and the time and date; and  \n \nseal the evidence in an envelope, write their initials across the envelope seal and secure it \nwith transparent tape. \nIf an authorized officer needs to remove and examine evidence from the envelope, the officer \nmust repeat the steps just described above when placing the evidence back in the envelope. If an \nofficer only needs to refer to a document, the officer should refer to the certified true copy on file.  \nIf a peace officer requires possession of the document from the immigration file for prosecution, \ngenerally, this would be done under a subpoena or a production order issued by the Court.

Officers may contact CBSA Case Management should assistance be required.  \nAn officer should make a note of these procedures, place the note on file for future reference and \nenter the information in the official notebook.  \n10.3 Liability for damage to property  \nIf a search results in damage to the traveller's vehicle or baggage, an officer must prepare a \nreport indicating the extent of the damage and other relevant details of the examination. For \nregulations and policy for handling damage claims against the Crown, see the Guidelines on \nClaims and Ex Gratia Payments. When a search brings no results, and the search caused \ndamage to the person's belongings, it is policy to return the conveyance or item to its original \nstate. When it is apparent that items may be damaged during a search because of their state of \nrepair or fragility, the officer should take before and after photographs of the items, to avoid the \nCBSA from having to pay for damages unrelated to the search.   \n10.4 CBSA liability for damage to a vehicle \nCBSA officers who seize a vehicle should make a careful inventory of any damage that the \nvehicle has and should ask the person from whom the vehicle was seized or the owner to give \nwritten acknowledgement of the inventory, if they are present at the time. \nA vehicle that is seized remains in the custody of the CBSA until all legislative requirements for its \nreturn or disposal have been complied with. \nThe CBSA may be liable for any damage caused to a vehicle in its custody depending on the \nfactual circumstances of each case. Any damages caused to a vehicle while under seizure should \nbe reported to the Regional office and to the Regional Director for appropriate assessment. \nOwners of a damaged seized vehicle may seek redress under a number of different laws.  \n11. Procedure: Disposition and return of seized things \n11.1 \nReturn of seized things \nSections 254 and 255 of the IRPR outline the requirements to determine when a seized thing can \nbe returned to its lawful owner or to a person from whom it was seized.  \nBoth the lawful owner and the person from whom the thing was seized have 60 days to submit an \napplication for the return of the seized thing, and the timeline begins upon the notice of seizure \n(and not the date of the seizure itself). If the notification is sent by mail, it is deemed to have been \nprovided seven days after the day on which the notice was mailed. Applications for the return of a \nseized thing can be made by using the BSF699 form. \nR256 states that should both the lawful owner and the person from whom the thing was seized \nmake concurrent applications, the lawful owner’s application will be processed first. If the \napplication of the lawful owner is granted, the application received from the person from whom \nthe thing was seized will not be processed. \nThe regulations require that an application for return must be made if the thing was seized on the \ngrounds of: \n \nbeing improperly or fraudulently obtained; \n \nbeing improperly or fraudulently used; and \n \nto prevent improper or fraudulent use. \nSeizures made on the grounds of being necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act are the \nonly types of seizure that cannot be returned upon application.

Also, foreign nationals issued a visitor record at a POE will \nnot be subject to biometric enrolment.  \nFor further details, please refer to the Biometrics Toolkit. \n12.3 Taking fingerprints \nOfficers are to use LiveScan kiosks wherever they are available. Ink and roll prints are only to be \nused when a LiveScan kiosk is not available and officers are processing applications in the \nRefugee or Criminal Charges workflows (please refer to section 12.5 for the description of each \nworkflow). For applications in the TR/PR Enrolment Workflow, the collection of fingerprints may \nbe overridden. For information on where the biometrics may be taken, please refer to section \n12.001 of the IRPR. \nLiveScan is an automated fingerprint system designed to capture fingerprints in an efficient and \naccurate manner without the use of ink. LiveScan records ten-print 'plain' fingerprint impressions, \nten-print 'rolled' fingerprint impressions, palm prints, writer's palm prints (side of the hand), and \nclient demographic information. LiveScan also records the subject's digital photo, which is \nelectronically printed on the fingerprint form. The fingerprint information is then encrypted and \ntransmitted to the RCMP’s Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) for search of \nregistered convictions and charges. \nLiveScan is an enforcement initiative that enhances capacity to electronically transmit biometric \nfingerprint data to the RCMP/HQ, improve fingerprint quality, reduce response times, and \nsafeguard fingerprint information. \nPlease refer to the LiveScan User Guide or the LiveScan Quick Reference Card for additional \ninformation. \n12.4 Obtaining access to LiveScan/CardScanner \nBefore gaining access to the LiveScan/Cardscanner you must complete a form: \n \nStep 1: Obtain the  LiveScan/CardScanner Acceptance Form by contacting your Regional \nCoordinator or the LiveScan team at livescan@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca.  \n \nStep 2: The Supervisor/Superintendent will email the following to the Regional Coordinator: \n- \nFirst/Last name; \n- \nUser ID; \n- \nName of the site where access is required; and \n- \nScanned copies of the forms \n \nStep 3: The Regional Coordinator will contact the LiveScan Team at livescan@cbsa-\nasfc.gc.ca. Upon receipt of the required information, the LiveScan team will grant system \naccess. \n \nPlease refer to the LiveScan User Guide or the LiveScan Quick Reference Card for additional \ninformation. \n \n"

Results obtained through the \nuse of the Criminal Record Check Workflow are accurate and conclusive because they are based \non a biometric match as opposed to a simple name and date of birth match. The Criminal Record \nCheck Workflow can be used to confirm a CPIC or NCIC result.  \n \n \nCriminal Charges Workflow – (CAR-Y) \nThe Criminal Charges Workflow is used when a person is charged with a criminal offence.  \nCurrently at the CBSA, the Criminal Charges Workflow is generally used by criminal investigators \nonly. Officers may be required to use Criminal Charges when submitting prints on behalf of other \nlaw enforcement partners. \n \n \nDeportee Workflow  \nThis workflow is used when a person is being deported or removed. \n \n       \nNOTE: Officers should be taking the fingerprints of all:  \n \nescorted removals (all escorted removals under a deportation order, including those \nunder a deemed deportation order); \n \ndeportees with a criminal record; and \n \ndeportees who do not have fingerprints on file. \n \n \nRefugee Workflow  \nThe Refugee Workflow is used to capture the biographic data, facial image and fingerprints of all \nrefugee applicants over the age of 14. This information is captured for two purposes: to query the \nAFIS database for registered convictions/charges and/or a previous refugee claim and to store \nthe fingerprint set in the AFIS refugee database. The RCMP retains refugee fingerprints until the \nclaimant becomes a Canadian citizen.   \n \n \nCivil Workflow \nAll CBSA sites have the authority to submit cases using the Civil Workflow. The Civil Workflow is \nused to capture fingerprints for civil purposes such as security clearances, employee background \nverifications, volunteer screenings, etc. All results will go to the Personnel Security Screening Unit \nat HQ in Ottawa. \n \n \n \nTR/PR Enrolment Workflow  \nThis workflow is used to biometrically enrol eligible travellers through the collection and \ntransmission of biographic information to RCMP for screening against the three (3) main \nrepositories: Criminal, Immigration, and Legacy Refugee. It is also mandatory for all PR \napplicants over the age of 14 to have their fingerprints collected. The fingerprints serve two \nmain purposes: the first is to query the AFIS database for registered convictions/charges \nand/or previous refugee claim, the second is to store the fingerprint set in the AFIS IMM \ndatabase.  \n \nFurthermore, when a foreign national or a permanent resident has their fingerprints captured by a \nCanadian police agency, the CBSA will automatically receive an Unsolicited Criminal Notification \n(UCN) if they were previously biometrically enrolled by the CBSA or IRCC in the TP/PR or \nRefugee workflows, including foreign nationals who provided biometrics for their Temporary \nResident Visa, Work Permit, Study Permit, or Temporary Resident Permit applications. \n \n"

As such, ink \nand roll fingerprint submissions will be dealt with in the following manner: \n \nCriminal removal ink and roll fingerprints from Inland Enforcement Officers should be sent to the \nFredericton Inland Enforcement Office: \nCanada Border Services Agency  \n495 Prospect Street \nFredericton, NB \nE3B 9M4 \nAttention: Manager of Enforcement and Intelligence \nAll CBSA offices conducting ink and roll fingerprints for all other reasons, such as refugee \nclaimants and prints taken following arrests or convictions for criminal charges, will now send their \nC216 forms to a designated regional CBSA office for scanning and submission to the RCMP. \nRegional LiveScan coordinators will identify and inform your office as to where the C216 forms \nshould be sent for scanning. To identify your Regional Coordinator, please contact the LiveScan \nProject Team at livescan@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca. All CBSA offices sending ink and roll fingerprints for \nscanning must include the BSF725 and ensure all necessary fields are properly completed.  \nThe CardScan application is used to scan fingerprint cards, palm prints, and photographs.  \nWhether all of these functions are available depends upon the chosen workflow. CardScan allows \nyou to scan the following cards: \n \nC-216 cards; \n \nRight palm print cards; \n \nLeft palm print cards; and  \n \nPhoto  \n \n \n12.7 Fingerprinting (ink and roll method) \nThe ink and roll method should only be used when LiveScan is not available. To take a proper \nset of ink and roll fingerprints, an officer needs the following:  \n \na print take ink strip: an inked strip containing a special ink for fingerprinting (some offices use \ninkless pads); \n \na print retainer pad: a rubberized pad to hold the ink strip flat; \n \na print form holder: a holder that contains the fingerprint form; \n \na pen; and  \n"

If done properly, \nthe weight of the finger should be sufficient to produce a good quality print as long as the \nofficer inked the finger properly.) \n \ndevelop a routine by printing the fingers in the order in which they appear on the form; at all \ntimes, start with the right thumb, continuing with the right index through to the right little finger, \nand then following with the left thumb, and left forefinger through to the left little finger. \n(Misplaced rolled impressions on the fingerprint form would result in a non-existent \nclassification, which could never be successfully searched in the fingerprint bureau.) \n \nroll thumbs inwardly and fingers outwardly. While there is no set rule governing the direction \nof rotation of the digits during the inking and printing process, experience has shown that \nthere is a natural tendency for thumbs to yield to an inwardly rotating motion (rolling the right \nthumb counter clockwise and the left thumb clockwise) and for the fingers to an outwardly \nrotating motion (rolling the right hand fingers clockwise and those of the left hand counter \nclockwise). \n \nalways centre the core area of the rolled impressions. \nPlain impressions of hand \nTo take plain impressions in the lower portion of the fingerprint form, the officer should:  \n \ntake the impressions with the four fingers of the hand extended; \n \nworking with one hand at a time, place the fingers simultaneously on the ink strip, applying \nfirm pressure equally to all to ensure even inking; \n \nplace the hand on the appropriate space on the form, again exerting even pressure to ensure \nuniform simultaneous printing; \n \nallow for flattening of the inked fingers. The fingers should not be held together too tightly. \nThis will ensure the reproduction of the greatest possible portion of the pattern in each finger. \nInk and record the thumbs similarly in the appropriate spaces without rolling.  \nPlain impressions serve to verify the accuracy of the sequence of the rolled impressions for the \nclassifier and searcher in the Fingerprint Section of the RCMP.  \n \n"

Officers should be considerate of religious and cultural \nsensitivities when taking photographs (e.g. photographing women who wear a veil) and try to \naccommodate the person being photographed whenever possible.  \n \nR12.1 lists the prescribed foreign nationals required to submit biometric information.  \n \nR12.3 specifically states that the prescribed biometric information to be collected is a photograph \nof the foreign national.   \n13.2 Taking photographs  \nWhile it is recognized that photographs may not always be taken under optimal conditions, it is \nimportant that officers take the best quality photographs possible. Photographs are an asset when \ntrying to locate an individual, issuing a warrant for arrest and for removal arrangements.   \nOfficers are required to scan and upload photographs to GCMS (eDocs) in addition to placing \nthem on the physical file. Circumstances may occur where the file cannot be physically \ntransferred to another office, therefore granting access to the photo will assist in confirming \nidentity.   \nWhen taking photographs, officers should: \n \nensure there is uniform lighting and not show shadows, glare or flash reflections; \n \nselect a plain white background with a clear difference between the face and the background; \n \nhave sunglasses, tinted eye glasses, excessive jewellery, hats and head coverings (unless \nthey are worn daily for religious beliefs or medical reasons) or anything that may impair the \npicture removed; \n \n ensure that if the hair is worn down it does not cover the face or ears; \n \nensure that if glasses are worn, the eyes are clearly visible and there is no glare in the \nglasses; \n \nensure the photo is taken with a neutral facial expression (person’s eyes are open and clearly \nvisible, mouth closed, no smiling); \n \nensure the photo is 50 mm wide X 70 mm high (2 inches wide x 2-3/4 inches long) and sized \nso the height of the face measures between 31 mm (1-1/4 inches) and 36 mm (1-7/16 inches) \nfrom chin to crown of head; \n \nensure the photo is taken straight on, with face and shoulders centred and squared to the \ncamera (i.e. the photograph must show the full front view of the person’s head and shoulders, \nshowing full face centred in the middle of the photograph); \n \nretake the picture making the appropriate adjustments if the quality of the photo is poor. \nOfficers should take as many pictures as they deem reasonable. Extra pictures should be taken \nand attached to the person’s file to be used as necessary at a later date. An optimal photo should \nconform to the following sample: \n"

A photograph can be an important means of identifying a child. \nAn officer should keep in mind that the comfort level of the child is very important. It is usually \nbest to photograph a child in the presence of a parent or guardian. A very young child who is not \ncomfortable being photographed alone may be photographed in the arms of a parent or legal \nguardian. \n13.4 Photographing Tattoos \n \nSubsection A16(3) does not give officers the legal authority to conduct searches and take \nphotographs of tattoos. Therefore, officers must rely on section A139 if they wish to do so. This \nmeans that officers need to have reasonable grounds to believe that circumstances described in \nA139(1)(a) or A139(1)(b) apply in order to perform a search and be able to articulate why the \nsearch was done. It is only in the context of a legal search as described in A139 and if an officer \nwere to incidentally come across any tattoos, that may support information relating to an IRPA \ninadmissibility, that an officer may take a photograph. Therefore, photographing tattoos at a Port \nof Entry should only be done in exceptional cases when a photograph of the tattoo combined with \nother information could provide evidence of an IRPA inadmissibility on any grounds (e.g. criminal \ninadmissibility, organized crime, security, war crimes, etc.). In such cases that an individual must \ndisrobe for a tattoo to be photographed, procedures outlined in section 6.11 on Conducting \nDisrobement Searches should be followed. If no link to an inadmissibility proceeding is being \npursued or exists, officers may note a presence of visible tattoos with a description in GCMS as a \npersonal identifier in the event the person is later subject to IRPA enforcement action. Officers \nshould not, however, rely on A139 IRPA search authority to collect information on tattoos merely \nfor intelligence collection purposes.  \n \n \n \n"
