The provision on espionage has been amended. The provision on subversion \nagainst any democratic government, institution or process has been established under a \nnew paragraph, namely A34(1)(b.1). Ministerial relief provisions under subsections \nA34(2), A35(2) and A37(2) have been repealed and replaced by section A42.1. \n \n \n2008-08-08 \nChanges were made to ENF 1 at 7.11 to correctly reflect the legislation. \n \n \n2006-07-13 \nChanges were made to chapter ENF 1 to remove references to “omissions” in the \ncontext of criminal inadmissibility. The term, which was contained in the provisions of \nthe former Act, is not contained in the IRPA.   \n \n \n2005-06-27 \nChanges were made to chapter ENF 1 in order to reflect the CIC and CBSA policy \nresponsibility and service delivery roles. \n \nCaselaw was added in Appendix A for cases involving A37(1)(a) and A40. \n \n \n2003-11-25 \nMinor changes were made to chapter ENF 1, entitled Inadmissibility. Section 7.18 and \nSection 7.19 — Security Review changed to Organized Crime Directorate. \n \n \n2003-07-16 \nBoth minor and substantive changes and clarifications have been made throughout \nENF 1 - Inadmissibility. It is recommended that any former version of this chapter be \ndiscarded in favour of the one now appearing in CIC Explore. \n \n \n2003-03-04 \nSection 7.19 has been amended to reflect that the Minister’s representative does not \nhave to prove that the organization is involved in criminal activity (A37(1)(b)). \n"

In most cases, persons not covered by the regulations may still be \nconsidered described or eligible for a specific relief provision after an assessment of the \nindividual evidence. In this way, the regulations and schedules are not exhaustive but \nwill address the most straightforward cases. \nThe purpose of regulations is to more objectively define criteria for specified allegations. \nThe aim is to increase the objective factor and reduce the subjective factor in the \ndecision-making process through greater codification in the regulations where possible. \nWith improved definition, greater transparency is introduced and outcomes or decisions \nbecome more predictable for some cases. \nReliance on regulations and schedules provides maximum flexibility and retains the \ngovernment’s capacity to respond quickly to environmental or policy shifts. \nThe Act groups regulation-making authority with the sections of the Act to which the \nregulations will be applicable. This makes it clearer, when reading the Act, where \nregulatory authority comes from, as well as its scope, limits and application. \nThe Act requires the Ministers to table any proposed regulations respecting \nexaminations, rights and obligations of permanent and temporary residents, loss of \nstatus and removal, detention and release, refugee eligibility, the pre-removal risk \nassessment, transportation companies and information-sharing before each House of \nParliament for referral to the appropriate Committee of that House.

To \nobtain a Minister’s acceptance, one would have to demonstrate that, \nnotwithstanding their position, there was no complicity in the objectionable acts of \nthat government. \nHussein v.

(2d) 23, \n91 F.T.R. 106 \n \nEquivalency is not met in the case where the Canadian statute is struck down for \nunconstitutionality. \n \nEquivalency is not required to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. All that is \nrequired is that the adjudicator determine that the applicant is a person with respect \nto whom there are “reasonable grounds to believe” that they have been convicted \noutside of Canada of an equivalent offence. \nHill v.

The fact that a person described in A36 does not possess proof of \nsatisfaction of the Minister is sufficient evidence for inadmissibility. \n \nThe immigration officer is not required to give the person concerned an opportunity \nto answer allegations contained in that report. \n \nThere are no problems of institutional independence because the adjudication \ndivision and the [hearings] officers are separate divisions that do not provide or take \nadvice to/from the other. \nR. v.

Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1994), 74 F.T.R. 38 \n \nRegardless of the applicant’s willingness to work, if they are unable to work in \nCanada, there must be proof of adequate arrangements for support. \nOrantes v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1990), 34 F.T.R. 184 \n \nCabinet cannot exempt anyone from any provision of the Act itself; this can only be \ndone by regulation, if permitted. This is necessary to preserve the rule of law. \nXu v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (April 13, 2000), Doc. IMM-\n6396-98 (Fed. T.D.) \n \nThe existence of the undertaking of support must be considered proof of support \nand not proof of an ability of the sponsor to fulfill the undertaking. \nA40(1)(a), (b), (c) and (d) \nJurisprudence \nBellido v.

T.D.). \n \nA permanent resident has been defined as a person who has been granted landing \nand who has not ceased to be a permanent resident pursuant to A46. \n \nThis case should be read in conjunction with Canada (Minister of Employment and \nImmigration) v. Selby, [1981] 1 F.C. 273, 110 D.L.R. (3d) 126 (Fed. C.A.). \nCanada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Nemsila (1996), 35 Imm. L.R. (2d) \n56, [1997] 1 F.C. 260, 118 F.T.R. 310 (Fed.

Immigration \nstatus is acquired at the port-of-entry. A change in marital status (from single to \nmarried) is a material fact that must be disclosed. \nCoombs v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1982] 1 F.C. 113 (Fed. \nC.A.) \n \nThe question “Are you a resident of Canada?” does not necessarily mean \n“permanent resident”. \nD’Souza v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1983] 1 F.C. 343 (Fed. \nC.A.) \n \nAn applicant need not be aware of a misrepresentation made on his behalf by \nanother in order to qualify under A40. \nDevrim v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (April 24, 1979), Doc. 78-\n6192 (Imm.

Canada (Minister of Manpower & Immigration), [1981] 1 F.C. 222 (Fed. \nC.A.) \n \nWhether a misrepresentation was of a material fact is a question of fact. There does \nnot need to be direct evidence that a visa would not have been granted had there \nbeen no misrepresentation. \n \nAn adjudicator will decide whether failure to disclose results in misrepresentation. \nMedel v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) 10 Imm. L.R. (2d) 274, \n[1990] 2 F.C. 345, 113 N.R. 1 (Fed.

T.D.) \n \nThe Court rejected the argument that in order for there to be “misrepresentation” \nthere must be an act of concealment. One can misrepresent as easily and \neffectively by silence as one can by actively stating a lie. \n \nThe Court rejected the argument that a misrepresentation must be knowingly or \nwillfully made. \nMoore v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (December 6, 1978), Doc. \n78-3016 (Imm. App. Bd.) \n \nThe Board held that mens rea is not an element of A27(2)(g), at least insofar as the \ndisclosure of the existence of dependants is concerned. \n"
