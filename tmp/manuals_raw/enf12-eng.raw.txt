Requirement to input FPS numbers in FOSS: 
 
In order to further streamline the administration of fingerprints, all cases where a person has been 
previously fingerprinted for immigration purposes and a Fingerprint (FPS) number exists, the FPS 
number must be entered in FOSS. The FPS number must be included in any subsequent request 
to the RCMP for additional checks or for follow-up information.   
Quoting the FPS number is the certified means to identify an individual.  Referencing the 
Fingerprint (FPS) number enhances a fingerprint query, facilitates turnaround times and reduces 
the need to duplicate fingerprinting.

1. 
What this chapter is about 
This chapter provides functional direction and guidance to Canada Border Services Agency 
(CBSA) and Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) officials when applying the 
search, seizure, fingerprinting and photographing provisions of the Immigration and Refugee 
Protection Act (IRPA) and Regulations (IRPR). 
The content and guidance found in this chapter is specfic to IRPA authorities. Officers (e.g. 
Border Services Officers) with mandates to enforce more than one Act of Parliament at the same 
time (e.g. during a POE examination) must ensure that they clearly know and understand which 
Act they are administering and/or enforcing as well as which authority they are relying upon.  
2. 
Program objectives 
The objectives of Canada’s immigration program concerning search, seizure, fingerprinting and 
photographing are: 
 
To protect public health and safety and to maintain the security of Canadian society; 
 
To promote international justice and security by denying access to Canadian territory to 
persons who are criminals or security risks; and 
 
To facilitate the entry of visitors, students and temporary workers for processes such as 
trade, commerce, tourism, international understanding and cultural, educational and 
scientific activities. 
The authorities to search, seize, fingerprint and photograph permit officers to: 
 
confirm the identity of persons seeking entry to Canada;  
 
ensure compliance with the Act and Regulations; 
 
seize and hold any means of transportation, document, or other thing that may be used 
for enforcing the Act and the Regulations, including evidence for prosecutions; 
 
prevent the misuse of documents that were fraudulently or improperly obtained; 
 
return and disposing of seized things; 
 
collect biometric information from a foreign national. 
3. 
The Act, Regulations and Designation & Delegation of Authority 
The following legislative authorities for an officer to search, seize, take fingerprints and 
photographs  are found in the IRPA and IRPR. Authorities may vary between POE and Inland and 
also between CBSA and IRCC officials. 
These provisions represent general enabling authorities. As such, officers must ensure that they 
are applied in the proper circumstances and by the appropriate individuals. Both the CBSA and 
IRCC IRPA Designation and Delegation Instruments should be consulted in order to determine 
that an officer is granted the authority to exercise the provisions in question.  
Pursuant to subsection 6(1) of the IRPA, both the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency 
Preparedness (PS) and the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada have the 
authority to designate any persons or class of persons to carry out any purpose of any provision

9 
of IRPA and have specified the powers and duties of the officers so designated. In addition, 
subsection 6(2) provides that anything that may be done by the Minister under the Act and 
Regulations may be done by a person that the Ministrer authorizes in writing. This is referred to 
as delegation of authority. 
The Designation of Officers and Delegation of Authority instrument stipulates who has the 
authority to perform specific immigration related functions. There are two Designation and 
Delegation Instruments (D&D). One is made by IRCC and the other by CBSA. In each Instrument, 
IRCC and CBSA designate and delegate authorities to their own officials based on listed job title, 
as well as to officials in the other departments. This is referred to as cross-designations and 
cross-delegations. Therefore, it is important that officials read both documents to know all IRPA 
authorities linked to their positions. 
The Instruments can be found on the CBSA Atlas page as well as the IRCC Connexion under 
Operational Manuals – IL3 Designation of Officers and Delegation of Authority. 
 
Provision: 
Refer to: 
A person who makes a claim, application or request under this Act must follow the 
procedures set out in the regulations for the collection and verification of biometric

document respecting that person; 
 
seize and remove any record or document to obtain copies or extracts; and 


documents that are relevant to their admissibility; or 
 
has committed or possesses documents that may be used in the 
commission of an offence in relation to smuggling and trafficking in

Departmental policy 
The CBSA is responsible for providing integrated border services that support national security 
and public safety and ensures the security and prosperity of Canada by managing the access of 
people and goods to and from Canada. The CBSA facilitates the entry of genuine travellers who 
comply with the legislation while restricting the access of travellers who are in non-compliance or 
have not satisfactorily established their identity. 
To achieve program objectives, the CBSA may search persons seeking entry into Canada in 
order to confirm their identity and ensure compliance with the Act. Officials may also seize 
documents or other things in order to prevent their fraudulent or improper use or to carry out the 
purposes of the Act.  
Furthermore, fingerprints and photographs may be taken to ensure effective identity management 
and risk assessment, which are critical in combating fraud, managing the movement of people 
and protecting Canada’s security interests. 
Officers are to support the objectives of the IRPA while ensuring that all decisions taken under the 
Act are consistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom (Charter). 
 
5. Legislative provisions 
5.1 Charter rights respecting search or seizure 
The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms (Charter) protects the basic rights of all persons in 
Canada, including foreign nationals. Sections 8 through 10 of the Charter govern an officer’s 
authority to conduct searches and seizure. 
5.2 Protection against unreasonable search or seizure 
Section 8 of the Charter provides that everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable 
search or seizure.  As such, officers can only search and seize in the course of their duties in a 
manner that meets this obligation under the Charter. Therefore, before conducting a search under 
the IRPA, an officer must establish that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a person 
seeking entry to Canada has not revealed their identity, has hidden documents relevant to their 
admissibility, or has concealed documents that may be used in the commission of an offence of 
smuggling or trafficking persons or for contraventions under the Act and Regulations. 
 
5.3 Right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned 
Section 9 of the Charter provides that everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or 
imprisoned.  When an involuntary personal search is being conducted, the person is considered 
to be detained because they cannot refuse to submit to the search and are not free to leave. 


===== PAGE 12 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
12 
When an officer believes on reasonable grounds that a search and seizure is appropriate, this 
also means that detention for the purpose of that search and seizure is appropriate as well. 
 
Search of the baggage of a person seeking entry to Canada is not considered to be a detention; 
however, a full body search of a person (disrobement) is considered to be a detention. It is not 
excepted that a disrobement search should often be required in the context of s. 139 IRPA 
search. 
5.4 Right to counsel when search constitutes detention 
Section 10 of the Charter requires that all persons being arrested or detained (including persons 
who are submitting to any type of involuntary personal search) be advised of the reason for the 
detention and of their right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. 
Officers must ensure that the person understands why a search is being conducted and 
necessary. Officers must take reasonable steps to provide an interpreter or other suitable person 
capable of speaking the language of the person when a language barrier is identified. Officers 
must also be mindful that the person appreciates the nature of what is taking place when dealing 
with vulnerable persons which include but are not limited to individuals with health, mental health 
or addiction issues, the elderly, minors and victims of trafficking.  
A personal (disrobement) search effectively places a person under detention. As such, the person 
must be advised of their rights and given an opportunity to contact counsel. Officers should 
provide a reasonable amount of time for the person to talk to a lawyer to obtain legal advice about 
their situation and must provide them with information on what legal aid services are available in 
the area. 
5.5  Solicitor-client privilege: Lavallee1 Supreme Court Decision 
The Supreme Court of Canada ruled in Lavallee that the confidentiality of communication 
between a lawyer and their client(s), in the context of search and seizure, is protected. On the 
rare occasion when an officer is faced with a solicitor-client privilege scenario, where the officer is 
in possession of a document that may give rise to solicitor-client privilege, an officer will need to  
refrain from infringing on that right.  
In order for solicitor-client privilege to apply, the following conditions must be met:  
1. there must be a communication between a client (or their agent) and a legal advisor; 
2. this communication entails the seeking or giving of legal advice; and 
3. this communication is intended by the parties to be confidential. 
There is an exception to solicitor-client privilege, namely when the client seeks guidance from a 
lawyer in order to facilitate the commission of fraud or crime. An exception also exists where 
communication is not intended to be confidential. Nevertheless, caution should be exercised 
before examining or seizing documents that could be subject to solicitor-client privilege. Officers 
should consult with their manager first, then seek further assistance from CBSA Case 
Management HQ, if needed. 
The officer should evaluate whether the examination of the document is necessary for the 
purposes of the IRPA and remain cognizant of the possibility that the documents may be subject 
to solicitor-client privilege. For example, if enough evidence exists to support an inadmissibility 
allegation or there are sufficient identity and travel documents to effect removal, then search and 
seizure of the document in question may not be necessary. Furthermore, if subject to solicitor-
client privilege, officers will need to ensure not to infringe upon that right. It is not expected that 
officers will have to deal with a large volume of documents that could be subject to solicitor-client 
privilege. Moreover, in the mail examination context, procedures put in place to protect any

potential solicitor-client privilege should be invoked as soon as an officer views documents to 
which solicitor-client privilege is attached and before a seizure is made under the IRPA.   
 
6. Procedure: Searches 
6.1 Authority and Reasonable Grounds to Search 
The authority to conduct a search of a person and their luggage, personal effects and the means 
of transportation that conveyed the person to Canada at a port of entry (POE) comes from  
A139(1), which requires that an officer must believe on reasonable grounds that the person 
seeking to come into Canada:  
 
has not revealed their identity;  
 
has hidden on or about their person documents that are relevant to their admissibility; or  
 
has concealed documents that may be or have been used for the purpose of smuggling or 
trafficking of persons into Canada or for other contraventions under the Act and Regulations.   
Case law has established that “reasonable grounds” is greater than mere suspicion or conjecture 
but less than the balance of probabilities. Reasonable grounds are grounds that, due to certain 
elements, facts, circumstances or available information, would lead an informed and experienced 
officer to believe that a violation of the IRPA or its Regulations may have occurred, are occurring 
or may occur.  
For example, an officer may believe that an undocumented refugee claimant, who is under 
examination, had a travel document when boarding the aircraft, as it would have been required by 
the airline. This circumstance may constitute reasonable grounds to do a baggage search and a 
personal (frisk) search. However, an officer who suspects that a foreign national, seeking entry to 
Canada as a temporary resident, intends to work without authorization – even though the foreign 
national has given consistent answers to the officer's questions – does not have reasonable 
grounds to conduct a baggage or personal search. In this instance, mere suspicion does not 
constitute reasonable grounds. The officer would require other grounds to support a search, such 
as a past history of untruthfulness or working without authorization and some indication that an 
immigration violation will occur. Officers must always document what led them to believe that a 
search was necessary.  
NOTE: A139(1) only applies when an individual is seeking to come into Canada. Therefore, 
it does not authorize officers to conduct searches in Canada in the absence of evidence 
the person is seeking entry (e.g. inland). This includes refugee claimants who were 
authorized to proceed in Canada for further examination pursuant to A23. Please refer to 
section 6.7 for additional details. 
6.2 Types of search pursuant to 139(1) of the IRPA 
CBSA officers are authorized to search any person seeking to come into Canada (POE) as per  
subsection 139(1) of the IRPA. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that officers are able to 
conduct a search when they have reasonable grounds to believe that the person seeking entry 
may not be providing their genuine identity, has hidden documents relevant to their admissibility, 
has committed a contravention of the IRPA, or possesses documents that may be used in the 
commission of any contravention of the IRPA.  
There are two types of search that an officer may pursue: a Preliminary Search and a Personal 
Search. 


===== PAGE 14 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
14 
A preliminary search at the POE involves the examination of all belongings that are with the 
person in the examination area, including digital devices, purses, briefcases, baggage, personal 
effects and any vehicle. This examination is for the purpose of detecting documents or evidence 
that relate to identity, admissibility and offences under the Act. For the examination of digital 
devices, please refer to section 6.15 – Examination of Digital Devices at the Port of Entry and in 
the Inland Enforcement Context. 
An officer may ask the individual undergoing a preliminary search to empty their pockets and to 
remove a coat or jacket for examination. This type of search does not involve physical contact 
with the individual. 
 
Type of 
search 
Explanation 
Preliminary 
Search 
Preliminary 
Search  
An officer who has reasonable grounds to believe that a person is 
seeking to enter Canada and may have documents relevant to identity 
or to admissibility hidden on them, in their luggage and/or conveyance 
or that were or may be used in the commission of an offence, may 
conduct a preliminary search. A preliminary search is conducted on a 
person’s luggage and personal belongings. This search may extend to 
the traveller’s means of transportation or checked baggage.  
Preliminary searches may also involve the search of the outer layers 
of clothing of a person. When searching the outer layers of clothing, 
officers may ask the person to empty their pockets and may search 
the outermost layer of clothing to ensure that the pockets are empty 
and that no additional pockets exist. Officers may also ask the person 
to remove the outer layer of clothing. Outer layers of clothing include 
items that when removed, could not reasonably be expected to 
expose the person in a manner considered inappropriate.These 
searches are part of a routine processing and do not raise any 
Charter concerns 
Please note that a search of the outer layers of clothing and a 
frisk search done for officer safety are not the same and they 
each have their own purpose and legal authorizations. 
No concurrence from a supervisor is required unless the search 
involves a minor child (see section immediately following this table). 
Personal 
Search 
Frisk Search 
involving 
physical 
contact 
A frisk search involving physical contact with the person in order to 
find documents hidden on or around their body is considered to be 
part of a personal search and therefore the person must be under 
arrest or detention. 
Please note that this is different from a frisk search done for 
officer safety. 
Approval from a supervisor is required for a frisk search to be 
conducted under 139(1) of the IRPA.  
Disrobement 
search 
A disrobement search involves the full or partial disrobement of a 
person to detect or obtain documents or other evidence that the 
person has concealed on their person. A disrobement search is 
considered a detention. A disrobement search should be a rare 
occurrence and must be performed by a person of the same sex as 


===== PAGE 15 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
15 
the person being searched. If an officer of the same sex is not 
available, any suitable person of the same sex may be authorized by 
an officer to perform the search. This search requires the approval 
from a supervisor, in all cases. 
 
6.3 Minor Children  
Special consideration must be applied when dealing with minors, particularly in the case of 
unaccompanied minors. An officer does not require approval from a supervisor to conduct a 
preliminary search unless the search involves a minor child. An officer conducting a search 
involving a minor child must demonstrate particular sensitivity for the emotional well-being of the 
child. The parent or adult accompanying the child should be present during the search. An officer 
must ensure that another officer is present throughout the duration of the search as the witness 
and the activity should be well documented. 
 
Note: If, when conducting a search, officers suspect that there may be a risk to the welfare of a 
minor child, whether the child is unaccompanied or not, provincial child protection authorities 
should be contacted. If a local child protection agency declines to become involved, officers 
should request this be put in writing and sent to them. All interactions with the child protection 
agency should be recorded in the officer notebook. Officers should also be alert to situations 
where it is possible that a child has been trafficked, smuggled or abducted.If they encounter 
such situations, officers should consult ENF 21 Recovering Missing, Abducted and Exploited 
Children, CBSA Enforcement (EN) manual, Part 2, Chapter 15 Trafficking in Persons as well 
as IRCC’s Program Delivery Instructions for victims of trafficking in persons. 
 
6.4 Search related to an offence under IRPA 
Pursuant to A139(1)(b), a CBSA officer may search any person seeking to enter Canada, 
including Canadian citizens, if the officer has reasonable grounds to believe the person has 
committed, or possesses documents that may be used in the commission of, an offence referred 
to in sections A117, A118 or A122. Since criminal charges may follow, officers should contact 
CBSA Criminal Investigations from the outset. 
 
Before searching or questioning any person about possible violations of the IRPA where charges 
may be laid, the officer must inform the person of their rights under section 10 of the Charter. If 
the officer questions the person concerning immigration offences (sections 117 to 137 of IRPA), 
any information obtained before the person is informed of their Charter rights may be inadmissible 
as evidence in subsequent prosecutions against the person. 
 
However, Canadian citizens, permanent residents, and persons registered as Indians under the 
Indian Act have the right to enter Canada if following an examination on their entry an officer is 
satisfied that the person is a citizen, permanent resident,or person registered as an Indian.  
Therefore, once an officer establishes that a person is Canadian, permanent resident or a person 
registered as an Indian, the officer must end the examination and authorize the person to enter 
Canada.   
 
In the case of Canadian citizens, permanent residents or persons registered as Indians, any delay 
in authorizing entry to Canada, including a personal search in the form of a disrobement search, 
conducted for immigration purposes, may constitute detention and the person would have to be 
advised of their right to counsel.  
 
In the case where a group is travelling together and travellers have different immigration status 
(e.g. Foreign National, Permanent Resident, Canadian Citizen), and an officer has determined 


===== PAGE 16 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
16 
that any or all members of the group will be searched, the officer must ensure that reasonable 
grounds exist for each individual person who undergoes a search. Concerns related to one 
member of the group do not authorize the search of other members of the group in order to 
search for evidence related to first traveller in question. 
 
6.5 Officer safety in conducting searches 
An officer should never assume that a person, including one that is detained, has been searched. 
Officer and public safety requires that search procedures be carefully observed and that 
appropriate documentation be completed in full. When custody of a detained person is being 
transferred from one officer or agency to another, search guidelines and clear communication are 
of critical importance. However, officers should be cognizant that the authority to search does not 
impose a duty to search. If an officer believes that they can conduct their work safely without 
conducting another search, for instance in cases where the custody of a person is transferred and 
the officer is satisfied that the person has been searched and the search has been documented, 
they may decide that no further search is necessary. 
The safety of the general public, as well as the officer’s own personal safety, are of the utmost 
importance and caution should be exercised at all times when conducting a search.  
6.6 General search procedures 
It is imperative that officers make notes of all details of any examination that leads to a 
preliminary or personal search, as well as the items found during the search. Officers may be 
called on to testify in court as to the reasonable grounds for the search. A second officer should 
witness the search and both officers should initial each evidence bag or container in which the 
seized items are held. This practice will assist in ensuring officer safety, as well as providing a 
witness in the event that allegations of impropriety are made against the officer. It may also assist 
in establishing the continuity of evidence.  
Any information relevant to conducting a search must be recorded in the officer’s notebook [BSF 
556] and in the client's file. Officers are required to keep a written record of each personal search 
conducted. All relevant information, including anything out of the ordinary that occurs and any 
comments made by the client, should be noted.  More information about note-taking procedures 
may be found in ENF 7 Immigration Investigations and IRPA s.55 Arrests/Detention. 
Officers conducting a search must maintain a professional demeanour and refrain from 
responding to profanity or abuse. Profane or abusive language directed at an officer is not a 
ground for arrest but may constitute a ground for an obstruction charge. Prior to arresting for 
obstruction (criminal offence), an officer should consult with Criminal Investigations.    
In addition, the following guidelines must be observed in every search situation:  
 
The person being searched shall not be left alone until the search is completed; 
 
The person’s belongings, particularly money and other valuables, should not be left 
unattended until the search is completed and the belongings have been secured; 
 
The person being searched shall first be asked to identify their goods or baggage and to 
confirm ownership. This will enable an officer to establish possession, should they find 
documents; 
 
The search of an individual's personal effects shall be conducted in a closed office or other 
area out of sight of the general public, but in the presence of the individual;  


===== PAGE 17 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
17 
 
Respect for the dignity of the person concerned must be demonstrated throughout the 
conduct of a search. This will help to alleviate some of the person’s anxiety and help to 
prevent the heightening of tension or escalation of uncooperative or violent behaviour;  
 
Unnecessary conversation, personal remarks and humour are to be carefully avoided by 
officers conducting the search. Officers should be considerate of the fact that this is a serious 
matter and stressful for the person who is being searched; 
 
A Search form (BSF899) must be completed in all cases at a POE and should be scanned 
and uploaded to GCMS to the ‘Clients’ screen at the following path: Clients>Documents>ID 
Supporting documents sub tab. Then select type: CDN Immigration Doc, sub-type: Client 
Submission and document #: (BSF899).  
6.7 Conducting Preliminary and Full Examination Searches at Ports of Entry 
Pursuant to A139(1), officers may search any person seeking to come into Canada. However, 
officers should be aware that there are different circumstances in which a person is considered to 
be seeking entry. Subsection 27(2) of the IRPR states that “a person who seeks to enter Canada 
at a place other than a port of entry must appear without delay for examination at the port of entry 
that is nearest to that place.”  
Therefore, in order to rely on POE examination provisions and related authorities, such as 
A139(1), officers will need to articulate that there is a geographic and temporal proximity to the 
border if, for example, a person crosses the border between ports of entry but is intercepted 
within a geographic and temporal proximity of the border and brought to a POE for an 
examination. This should be reflected in officer notes in GCMS and in the client’s file. 
Searches pursuant to subsection A139(1) are linked to the fact that the person crossed 
international borders, and as such they have a lower expectation of privacy. The BSO conducting 
the initial examination, before deciding if authorizing entry under A23 is warranted, may perform a 
search if they feel it is necessary. However, once a person has been authorized to enter Canada 
under A23 and presents themselves at a CBSA office, the officer cannot be reasonably certain 
that the person will have in their possession the same documents to support a determination of 
admissibility or eligibility, personal digital devices, or other items they had with them upon entry. 
The person is still under examination and the officer may ask or require certain information 
pursuant to section A16, however this does not equate to a search under A139. 
All searches are to be conducted in a courteous and professional manner in accordance with the 
CBSA Code of Conduct. 
When conducting a preliminary or full examination search at a POE, an officer should:  
 
take measures to ensure their own health and safety as well as that of fellow officers and the 
public; 
 
complete the applicable section of the Search form [BSF899];  
 
explain to the person why their baggage or vehicle is being searched;  
 
arrange an interview if the person requests permission to speak to a supervisor; 
 
make detailed notes in their notebook of any articles relating to immigration that are found; 
 
confirm ownership of all baggage by asking the following questions: 
 Is this your bag?  


===== PAGE 18 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
18 
 Did you pack it yourself?  
 Are you aware of the contents?  
 Did you, at any time after packing your bag, leave it unattended? 
6.8 Conducting a search of carry-on luggage  
While officers have the authority to search at the port of entry as per A139(1), it is imperative that 
the grounds to perform the search exist. Therefore,it is not enough that the luggage is at the POE.  
A139(1) only authorizes officers to conduct a search under IRPA, not for Customs Act or other 
reasons. 
Officers will find it easier to search carry-on luggage if they develop a systematic approach. 
Officers should wear kevlar or other protective gloves for personal safety.  
Once a search has begun, the person whose belongings are being searched must never be left 
alone. 
6.9 Conducting personal searches  
Personal searches include frisk and disrobement searches. Because these searches involve 
physical contact, they are of a more sensitive nature. When searching persons under IRPA, 
officers will encounter cases requiring sensitivity and careful considerations, such as when they 
are dealing with vulnerable persons. 
 
Searching vulnerable persons 
When conducting personal searches pursuant to subsection 139(1) of IRPA, it is important for 
officers to identify vulnerable persons at the earliest opportunity in order to ensure that 
appropriate considerations are factored into decisions and/or any actions taken during the search. 
The following are some examples of persons who may be identified as vulnerable: 
 
minors (under the age of 18)/ unaccompanied minors; 
 
elderly persons; 
 
individuals with severe medical conditions or physical disabilities; 
 
pregnant persons and nursing mothers; 
 
persons with a suspected or known mental illness (includes suicidal persons and persons 
who self-harm); 
 
victims/suspected victims of human trafficking or family related violence. 
Other persons may display less obvious symptoms of a vulnerability, which may not become 
apparent until the person is searched: 
 
victims of gender-based violence may become distressed during a personal search. They 
may also show signs of distress at the prospect of being searched by an officer of a 
different gender; 
 
victims of trauma may have difficulty coping with the search because it is performed by 
persons in uniform or because they are confined in a closed room with officers. 
 
Personal searches 


===== PAGE 19 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
19 
The first step in any personal search is to seek the person's co-operation by explaining to the 
person what is involved in a search.  
If a person does not comply with being frisk-searched, it may be necessary for an officer to 
determine whether detention is necessary in order for the examination to be completed. If an 
officer makes the decision to detain, the officer must inform the person that they are detained and 
immediately advise them of their right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. The grounds 
for the detention should be explained to the person.  
Prior to an officer conducting a personal search that involves disrobement, an officer is required 
to read the following to the person being searched: 
 
“I have reasonable grounds to believe that you [have hidden documents on or about your 
person that are relevant to your admissibility/have not revealed your identity/have 
committed an offence related to human smuggling or trafficking/documents] and I am 
detaining you for the purposes of a search of your person as authorized by section 139 of 
the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Do you understand? 
 
You have the right to retain and instruct counsel of your choice, in private and without 
delay. You have the right to free and immediate legal advice from duty counsel. Duty 
counsel is available at _____: during the following hours: _____ . You have the right to 
apply for legal assistance without charge through the Provincial Legal Aid program. The 
Legal Aid telephone number in this area is: _____. Their office is located at: _____ and 
office hours are from ______. Do you understand? Do you wish to call a lawyer now? 
 
You need not say anything. You have nothing to hope from any promise or favour, or 
nothing to fear from any threat, whether or not you do say anything. Anything you do say 
may be used in evidence. Do you understand?” 
 
A139(2) requires that a search of a person seeking to come into Canada be performed by a 
person of the same sex as the person being searched. If an officer of the same sex is not 
available, any suitable person of the same sex may be authorized by an officer to perform the 
search. Officers should be aware that other considerations may arise, specifically in the context of 
gender diversity, which includes all transgender, gender-fluid, non-binary, two-spirit, cisgender, 
and other gender identities. Please consult the Internationally recognized sexual orientation or 
gender identity of expression (SOGIE) definitions for additional information. 
Should a situation arise where a personal search is required on a person who self identifies as 
gender diverse, the CBSA must provide the individual with a choice of the sex of the officer who 
will conduct the personal search. The options that will be available to the individual are: 
A. Male officers only; 
B. Female officers only; or 
C. A split search. 
Although these options are specific to a person seeking entry into Canada, and mandated by 
IRPA, they are principles that should be applied in the Inland context (search incidental to arrest) 
whenever possible.  
A split search is conducted by two sets of officers, the first set completes the search of the upper 
body while leaving the lower body clothed. The individual is then permitted to fully dress, and is 
turned over to a second set of officers of the opposite sex to conduct the search of the lower 
body, while the upper body remains clothed. The individual being searched will be fully observed 
at all times during the turnover from the first set of officers to the second set of officers to ensure 
that continuity of any potential evidence is maintained throughout the search process.

Once the individual has chosen the sex of the officers conducting the personal search, the choice 
will be recorded in the notebooks of all officers involved.   
If not previously known that the person being searched is a gender diverse person, but it 
becomes evident at any point during the personal search that this is the case, officers will 
immediately stop the personal search and offer the individual the choice of the sex of the officers 
who will continue the personal search. 
Officers must follow all relevant guidelines and procedures related to handling cases concerning 
sexual orientation and gender identity and expression during IRPA searches. This includes being 
sensitive to gender-related issues when speaking to the person, and being careful to use gender 
terms that reflect the person’s gender identification or gender-neutral terms when referring to the 
person in documents/notes or completing IRPA forms. 
An officer should commence a personal search by: 
 
explaining the reason for the search to the person concerned; 
 
explaining, if challenged, the legal authority under A139(1) for the officer to conduct the 
search; and 
 
making arrangements, where the person is detained and wishes to exercise their rights under 
the Charter, for access to a telephone and to a telephone directory. An officer may observe 
the person but may not listen to their conversation with counsel. However, the officer should 
be prepared to intervene if the person is observed in attempting to destroy or conceal 
evidence.  
6.10 Conducting frisk searches involving physical contact 
An officer conducting a frisk search involving physical contact should: 
 
obtain supervisor’s approval to conduct a frisk search; 
 
arrest and/or detain the person; 
 
explain the reason for the search to the person concerned; 
 
explain, if challenged, the legal authority under A139(1) for the officer to conduct the search;  
 
recognizing that it may not always be possible, a person’s privacy should be protected by 
conducting the search out of the view of the public whenever possible; 
 
ask, prior to the commencement of the search, if the person has anything on them that could 
harm them or the officer conducting the search, and if so, to surrender it; 
 
conduct a search for weapons using a metal detector wand, where available. Before using the 
wand, persons must be asked if they are wearing a pacemaker or other similar heart 
device.Those who identify as wearing one should only be frisked manually;  
 
ask the person to remove any outer garments such as a jacket, coat or sweater and all 
objects from their pockets;  
 
should circumstances require that the person being searched needs to be separated from 
their personal belongings, account for the personal items and ensure they are returned to the 
person at the end of the search, unless the items are being seized; 


===== PAGE 21 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
21 
 
record in the BSO’s notebook [BSF556] all information pertaining to the search; charges may 
result and an officer may be required to testify in court. (More information on using the 
notebook is available in ENF 7 Immigration Investigations and IRPA s.55 Arrests/Detention.) 
 
seize and hold any documents or evidence that relates to identity or to the commission of an 
offence under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act; 
 
in cases where the search was resultant and required a BSF899 form to be filled out before 
the person who was searched leaves the room, ensure that they sign part E of the BSF899 
and that they are satisfied that they have received all their property, unless it has been 
seized. This will help prevent claims of theft. If the person claims to be missing items, the 
officer should review the search form with the person to determine what is missing and 
attempt to resolve the situation; and 
 
in cases where an officer discovers illicit contraband, such as weapons or drugs, they will 
immediately arrest, advise and caution the person. For more information related to the 
discovery of illicit contraband at the POE, refer to CBSA Enforcement Manual – Part 6. 
6.11. Conducting disrobement searches  
Conducting a disrobement search while officers are enforcing the IRPA would only occur under 
exceptional circumstances. An officer must obtain a supervisor’s approval prior to conducting a 
disrobement search. The purpose of a search under IRPA is to locate documents; consequently, 
it will be extremely rare that a person will hide documentary evidence in a location that would 
require disrobement. 
There may be a situation where, as a result of the frisk search, it may be necessary to have the 
person disrobe so that an officer can search for or remove evidence.  
A disrobement search consitutes a detention. As such, prior to commencing the search, an officer 
must advise the person of their rights under the Charter, specifically the right to retain and instruct 
counsel, and must give the person a reasonable opportunity to exercise those rights. The grounds 
for the detention should be fully explained to the person. Once the person has had an opportunity 
to contact counsel, the search can proceed. It is not necessary to delay a search until the arrival 
of counsel.  
Immediately after an officer advises the person of their Charter rights, or as a simultaneous 
action, but before the person enters the search room or has access to a telephone, the person 
should be frisked for weapons. This frisk is a precaution to ensure the safety of the officer and all 
persons in the inspection area and is not meant to discover evidence. An officer may use a metal-
detector wand if one is available.  
Officers must ensure that disrobement searches are properly documented, including notes to be 
kept on file. Resultant disrobement searches will also require proper documentation of any 
associated seizures.  
6.12. Conducting a search of a means of transportation  
Pursuant to A139(1), an officer may search a means of transportation that conveyed the person 
to Canada. In order for an officer at the POE to conduct a lawful search of a conveyance, there 
needs to be reasonable grounds to believe there are documents which reveal the person’s 
identity, are relevant to their admissibility, or may be used in the commission of an offence, 
namely human smuggling, trafficking or to otherwise contravene the IRPA. 
Documents and papers that are in a vehicle or are in the occupants’ possession may offer clues 
regarding other parties who have a legal interest in a means of transportation. Those documents 
should be examined and if necessary, may be copied. In the event that a means of transportation 


===== PAGE 22 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
22 
is seized, these documents may assist an officer in satisfying the requirement of R253 to identify 
any person who is a lawful owner of a thing seized under A140(1) and to provide that person with 
written notice of, and reasons for, the seizure.  
Under subsection A15(3), an officer has the authority to board and inspect any means of 
transportation and to examine and record documents pertaining to persons carried by that means 
of transportation. Although there is nothing in the wording of A15(3) limiting this authority to the 
POE, however, in order to rely on this provision to conduct a search, there must be some 
temporal and geographic connection to the POE. For example, if there is evidence that a 
conveyance was used to bring individuals into Canada, such as law enforcement agency 
observing this take place or it being captured on video, an officer with delegated authority under 
A15(3) could inspect the conveyance in the context described above. However, even if it is 
believed that a conveyance was used to transport persons into Canada, it may be difficult to 
justify the use of this provision some distance from the border. 
6.13  
Removal of the contents of a means of transportation 
An officer should ensure that any items of monetary or potentially sentimental value in a seized 
means of transportation are removed and returned to the transporter. While a seized means of 
transportation should not be stripped of all of its contents, officers should remove items to limit the 
Agency’s liability. It may be prudent for the officer to allow the transporter to witness the search. If 
that person is disruptive or unruly, the officer should have another officer nearby to witness any 
items removed.  
An officer should record or document items removed from the means of transportation and 
returned to the transporter, and should get that individual’s signed acknowledgement that they 
have received the items. This may alleviate possible allegations of impropriety on the part of the 
officer. 
6.14 
Completing the Search form BSF899 
The BSF899 is meant to ensure national consistency when documenting searches conducted 
under subsection 139(1) of the IRPA. Officers must complete the appropriate section(s) of the 
BSF899 in the following circumstances: 
 
1. Preliminary searches and full examination searches that are resultant require that the BSF899 
be completed. If a preliminary search and/or full examination is non-resultant, the BSF899 is not 
required and a record of such a search in an officer’s notebook is sufficient.  
2. Personal searches, whether a frisk search or disrobement require that the BSF899 be 
completed in addition to any record in an officer’s notebook.  
When completing the BSF899, it is important to ensure the following:  
Fully complete the top portion of the form labelled “Traveller identification”.   
Part A – Search: This section must be completed in all instances where the BSF899 is being 
completed.  
 
Note: In the case of non-resultant preliminary searches that do not require the completion 
of the BSF899, officers must still ensure: 
 
that the person being searched is informed of the authority to search found in 
subsection 139(1) of the IRPA; 
 
that the person being searched is informed of the reasonable grounds for the search; 
 
the times that the search commenced and ended are documented in the officer’s 
notes; and 


===== PAGE 23 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
23 
 
whether the search was resultant or non-resultant is documented in the officer’s 
notes 
Part B – Preliminary Search: must be completed when a preliminary search and/or full 
examination is resultant and must include the results of the search and the location of where the 
documents or evidence were found; 
 
Part C – Personal Search: must be completed in all instances when a personal search is 
conducted, whether a frisk involving physical contact or disrobement search. This must include 
the names and signatures of the searching officer(s) and the witness of the search, as well as the 
supervisor’s signature indicating whether or not the search was authorized. If the authorization 
was provided by telephone, this information should be noted on the form. 
 
Part D – Disrobement Search: must be completed in addition to Part C in all instances where a 
disrobement search is conducted as it constitutes a detention and requires further documentation 
specific to the right to counsel.   
 
Part E – Return of Personal Effects: must be completed to ensure that if personal effects are 
returned, save for those seized, the person signs for receipt of the items. 
 
Part F – Interpreter declaration: must be completed in any instances where an interpreter was 
required to conduct the search.  
6.15 
Examination of Digital Devices at the Port of Entry and in the Inland Enforcement 
context 
Ports of Entry 
Digital devices, media, documents, software and stored electronic data are considered “goods” 
under CBSA program legislation and are subject to examination by CBSA officers at ports of 
entry. For procedures related to the examination of digital devices for the administration and 
enforcement of the IRPA at a Port of Entry, please refer to the CBSA Policy on Port of Entry 
Examinations of Travellers' Digital Devices (Enforcement Manual (EN) Part 4, Chapter 16) on 
Atlas.  
Inland Enforcement 
Inland Enforcement Officers should not rely on A139(1) to examine digital devices since A139(1) 
only allows for searches of persons seeking entry to Canada. 
A16(3) of the IRPA allows an officer to require or obtain evidence from a permanent resident or a 
foreign national who is arrested, detained, subject to an examination or subject to a removal 
order, any evidence - photographic, fingerprint or otherwise - that may be used to establish their 
identity or compliance with the Act. That said, A16(3) should not be relied upon as an authority to 
conduct examinations of digital devices for inland investigative purposes. Furthermore, Inland 
Enforcement Officers cannot rely on Criminal Code of Canada warrants to search digital devices 
and gather evidence for inland investigations.  
Officers may examine digital devices only if they obtain the person concerned’s written valid 
consent (i.e. informed and voluntary). The person’s written consent must be obtained and 
recorded on the BSF 835 form. Officers may, with the foreign national’s or permanent resident’s 
valid consent, examine a digital device in support of the administration and enforcement of the 
IRPA for Inland Enforcement purposes. For additional information on the examination of digital 
devices in the Inland Enforcement context and valid consent, please refer to section 19.18 – 
Searching an arrested person of ENF 7.

7. Additional Types of Search  
7.1 Search incidental to arrest 
In common law, a peace officer may carry out a search of a person who has been lawfully 
arrested. The existence of reasonable grounds is not a prerequisite to the existence of such a 
power. 
The courts have ruled that when conducting a search of an arrested person a peace officer is 
authorized to remove from that person any of the following three types of items:  
 
weapons or implements that might assist in the person's escape;  
 
anything with which a person might injure themselves or others; or 
 
anything that can be considered as evidence of the offence for which the person has been 
arrested.  
In the Supreme Court of Canada decisions Cloutier v. Langlois, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 158  and R. v. 
Caslake, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 51, precedents for searches incidental to arrest were established. In 
these decisions, the Supreme Court held that a search is constitutional if conducted without the 
use of excessive force or constraint and for some valid purpose connected to the arrest, namely: 
 
to ensure the safety of the arresting officers; or 
 
to protect evidence from destruction at the hands of the person under arrest.  
The authority to arrest and detain compels a detained person to comply with a search by an 
officer exercising that authority. Search incidental to arrest applies only to things in the 
possession or immediate surroundings of the person arrested. Immediate surroundings may be 
searched for the purposes previously listed. Because the jurisprudence that establishes the 
principle of search incidental to arrest is related to criminal cases and because arrests under A55 
are not made in connection with a criminal offence, any searches of the location in which the 
individual was arrested for the purpose of seeking evidence of an IRPA inadmissibility or a travel 
document may be held unreasonable and not in compliance of section 8 of the Charter. 
The power to search incidental to arrest is a discretionary one and need not be exercised where 
the peace officer is satisfied that the law can be effectively and safely applied in its absence. 
Note: Searches conducted in the inland enforcement context can only be conducted incidental to 
arrest. The authority to search incidental to arrest is governed by common law. The authority to 
search under A139(1) cannot be relied upon in the inland enforcement context to conduct 
searches. 
7.2 Conducting a Frisk Search Incidental to Arrest  
When a designated CBSA officer has completed an IRPA arrest and detention of an individual, 
which includes informing the individual of their Charter rights to speak with counsel, as well as 
their rights under the Vienna Convention, the officer may conduct a frisk search of the person 
incidental to the arrest.    
 
A search applies to anything in possession or within the immediate surroundings of the arrested 
person. Three conditions must be satisfied in order for the search of the person to be justifiable: 
 
 
the arrest must be lawful; 
 


===== PAGE 25 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
25 
 
the search must be conducted as incidental to a lawful arrest; and 
 
 
the search must be carried out in a reasonable manner. 
 
If during the search, an officer discovers any means of transportation, document or other thing 
that the officer believes on reasonable grounds to be fraudulently or improperly obtained or used, 
or that the seizure is necessary to prevent its fraudulent or improper use, or to carry out the 
purposes of the Act, the officer may seize and hold any of the aforementioned items as per 
section 140(1) of the IRPA. The officer must provide written notice of any seizure and otherwise 
follow the instructions as per section 8 of this chapter. 
7.3 Search warrants 
Outside of the authority to conduct searches incidental to arrest, inland enforcement officers are 
not permitted to search for evidence of an offence. Although A138(1) provides that an officer has 
the authority and powers of a peace officer – including those set out in sections 487 to 492.2 of 
the Criminal Code (CC) to enforce the IRPA, the use of section 487 of the CC provisions is 
limited, by its own wording, to situations where there are reasonable grounds to believe that there 
is evidence in the specific place named in the warrant which would relate to an offence (i.e. 
criminal offence). Unlike section 43 of the Customs Act, the IRPA does not contain any 
provisions for compelling the production of records for administrative or non-criminal enforcement 
purposes. 
Inland Enforcement Officers cannot rely on CC search warrants or production orders without 
reasonable grounds to believe that evidence of a criminal offence will be found in that place. So 
while CC warrants can be used to investigate a criminal offence under IRPA, these warrants 
cannot be obtained for purposes other than obtaining evidence of a criminal offence. Therefore, 
officers cannot rely on CC search warrants to gather evidence in support of an inadmissibility 
report under A44(1). 
 
Where a CBSA inland enforcement officer suspects a criminal offence under IRPA has occurred 
and evidence in the form of documents or information relating to the offence may be found in a 
specific place, they should engage a CBSA criminal investigator. 
Criminal investigators will assess the case specifics and, if a criminal investigation and search 
warrant/production order are warranted, will discuss with the referring officer. 
Where it can be reasonably demonstrated that an IRPA criminal offence (pursuant to Part 3 – 
Enforcement of the IRPA) has occurred and that information at a specific place will afford 
evidence of that offence (potentially including information that may be used to locate an individual 
or a document), a search warrant or production order may be requested pursuant to s. 487 CC 
and s. 487.012, respectively. These search warrants must be prepared and obtained by CBSA 
Criminal Investigators, in the context of their investigation towards the laying of criminal charges. 
 
8. Procedure: Seizures 
8.1 Authority and grounds for seizure 
A140 provides the legislative authority to seize any means of transportation, documents or other 
thing if an officer believes on reasonable grounds that it was fraudulently or improperly obtained 
or used or that the seizure is necessary to prevent its fraudulent or improper use or to carry out 
the purposes of the Act. Both IRCC and the CBSA officials are designated with the authority to 
seize documents and other things. However, only CBSA officers have been designated with the 
authority to seize a means of transportation. 


===== PAGE 26 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
26 
A148(2) provides the legislative authority to detain, seize or forfeit all or part of any security 
provided by a transporter as well as any vehicle or other prescribed good owned or operated by a 
transporter if they fail to comply with an obligation under IRPA.  
Although a seizure under A148(2) may occur without a vehicle being detained first, seizures 
should be used as a last resort.  A vehicle that is detained remains in the possession of the 
transporter, however, when the vehicle is seized, the CBSA takes possession of the vehicle and 
becomes liable for the costs of handling, maintaining and disposing of it. The vehicle is seized as 
soon as an officer delivers the notice of seizure. The delegated authority to seize a vehicle under 
subsection A148(2) can be found in the Instruments of Designation and Delegation. For additional 
information relating to seizures made under the authority of A148(2), refer to ENF 15.  
In the case of persons seeking entry in to Canada, A15(3) provides the legislative authority for an 
officer to board and inspect any means of transportation bringing persons to Canada, examine 
any person carried by that means of transportation and any record or document respecting that 
person, and to seize and remove the record or document to obtain copies or extracts and hold the 
means of transportation until the inspection and examination are completed.  
Limitation period for seizures 
There is no limitation period for seizures of things on the grounds that they were fraudulently or 
improperly obtained or used. These seizures may occur as necessary when lawful and 
appropriate. 
8.2 Seizing documents  
While the authority to seize under the IRPA will primarily be applicable to situations involving 
foreign nationals or permanent residents, this provision also applies to Canadian citizens if the 
conditions of A140(1) are met. In all cases, officers are required to articulate the grounds for the 
seizure.   
IRCC officers who have reasonable grounds to believe that documents were fraudulently or 
improperly obtained or used may seize those documents and if necessary, transfer custody to the 
CBSA for further examination and/or investigation. This includes seizure of identity, travel and/or 
other documents as evidence or to effect a removal, should an individual become subject to an 
enforceable removal order. Although it is not a Charter right, if a person from whom a thing has 
been seized wants to contact legal counsel, the officer should make every effort to facilitate this 
request if is reasonable to do so. This may be as simple as providing the individual with 
opportunity and means to make a telephone call. Officers should record in their notebook whether 
the person contacted legal counsel. 
Following a seizure made by an officer pursuant to A140(1), the officer is required by R253(1) to 
make reasonable efforts: 
(1) to identify the lawful owner of thing seized; and 
(2) to give the lawful owner written notice of and reasons for the seizure 
For travel documents, the notice of seizure given to the bearer should be sufficent to allow the 
officers to fulfill their obligations under R253(1) without having to notify the issuing country. 
Officers seizing travel and/or identity documents as well as other things (e.g. ticket stubs, 
employment information, conveyances, etc.) must document the seizure on the  Notice of 
Seizure of (a) Travel and/or Identity Document(s) and/or Other Thing(s) [BSF 698] and to 
include the reasons for the seizure as well as information on how/where individuals may make an 
Application for the Return of (a) Seized Travel and/or Identity Document(s) and/or Other 
Thing(s) [BSF 699].   


===== PAGE 27 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
27 
Note: In keeping with CBSA policy, officers should, for each document seized, provide the 
person from whom documents are seized with a copy of the seizure form, which will serve as 
a Notice of Seizure receipt. 
Individuals may require certified true copies of genuine documents, for instance when seeking 
access to federal and provincial programs or services. In those cases, if the documents are 
genuine and the individual from whom the document(s) is (are) seized is the rightful holder, 
officers will make colour copies, certify them as true copies and provide the certified true copies to 
the individual from whom the documents were seized. 
Examples of document seizures to prevent fraudulent or improper use include but are not limited 
to:  
 
Document(s) (Confirmation of Permanent Residence, Permanent Resident Card, Study 
Permit, Work Permit, Temporary Resident Permit, Temporary Resident Visa, travel 
documents, etc.) issued to an individual other than the individual  who is in possession of the 
document(s) where the individual does not have a valid explanation for being in possession of 
the document(s) and the document(s) was/ were not used to enter or exit Canada or another 
country; 
 
Blank identity or travel documents, such as a blank passport or national identity card. 
Examples of fraudulent documents, include, but are not limited to: 
 
altered documents (e.g. photo-substitution and page substitution) and alterations of variable 
mentions (such as date of birth and name) or erasures, and unauthorized additions such as 
counterfeit entry and/or exit stamps and/or visas; 
 
counterfeit documents; 
 
improperly obtained or issued documents; 
 
fantasy documents. 
Examples of documents that may be seized to carry out the purposes of the Act include, but are 
not limited to:  
 
travel documents (e.g. passports, certificates of identity, laissez-passer or refugee travel 
documents); 
 
personal identification (e.g. U.S. social security cards, driver’s licences or any other form of 
personal identification that may or may not include a photograph of the holder); 
 
IRCC-issued documents (e.g. Permanent Resident Card, Confirmation of Permanent 
Residence/IMM 1000, Citizenship card); 
 
airline tickets; 
 
itineraries; 
 
work records; 
 
inmate identification; 


===== PAGE 28 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
28 
 
criminal records documents (e.g. court transcripts, tickets, arrest reports); 
 
medical history, charts, prescriptions, receipts, notes;  
 
letters, pictures, video tapes; 
 
phone and address books; and/or 
 
purchase receipts. 
There are different situations that may occur in which an officer will have grounds to seize and 
hold a means of transportation, a document or other thing. Officers should consider each case 
individually and assess if the seizure meets the grounds articulated in the IRPA. The following are 
potential circumstances when a seizure of a travel document may be appropriate. 
Scenario 1 
A foreign national has been charged with a criminal offence in Canada but has been released on 
recognizance to appear in a Canadian court. The foreign national left the country but is now 
seeking entry to Canada to appear in a Canadian court.  An officer may decide to adjourn the 
examination as per A23, and determine there are reasonable grounds to seize the foreign 
national’s passport as per A140(1) to carry out the purposes of the Act, namely to ensure the 
foreign national will appear to complete their examination as well as any other enforcement action 
(e.g. removal), in the event that the foreign national is convicted. If this occurs, the passport will 
be required to enforce the removal. The officer will complete and provide a BSF698: Notice of 
Seizure of (a) Travel and/or Identity Document(s) and/or Other Thing(s).  
Scenario 2 
A foreign national is seeking entry to Canada at a POE and provides their travel document to an 
officer for examination. During the course of the examination, the officer examines the document 
and believes that there has been an alteration made to the photograph. If the officer believes that 
there are reasonable grounds to believe that the document has been fraudulently obtained or 
used, they may seize the travel document under A140(1). The officer should evaluate 
inadmissibility and consider addtional enforcement options such as arrest and detention as 
appropriate, if they are not satisfied of the foreign national’s identity. The officer should also 
consult with Criminal Investigations Division as the use of a fraudulent document is an offence 
under the IRPA. The officer will provide a BSF698: Notice of Seizure of (a) Travel and/or Identity 
Document(s) and/or Other Thing(s) to the individual. Officers may also refer the document to 
regional Document Analysis Units (DAUs) if appropriate. Please refer to section 8.7 for additional 
details on sending documents for analysis. 
Scenario 3 
A Permanent Resident is convicted in Canada of a serious offence and is reported by an officer 
pursuant to A44(1). The report is referred to the Immigration Division for an admissibility hearing. 
The officer concludes that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the seizure of the 
permanent resident’s passport is necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act as per A140(1).  
If a removal order is issued and becomes enforceable, CBSA requires the passport to enforce the 
removal order. The officer may provide a certified copy of the document in addition to the 
BSF698: Notice of Seizure of (a) Travel and/or Identity Document(s) and/or Other Thing(s). If, 
however, a referral for the admissibility hearing is later withdrawn or the PR is found not 
described (i.e. no removal order is issued), officers must return the seized document. 


===== PAGE 29 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
29 
Note: Admissibility hearings for released cases may be subject to lenghty time periods before 
being heard and Permanent Residents may reasonably require their passport to travel to and 
from Canada. Given that they have not yet lost their status per A46(1), officers should 
consider returning the travel document if requested. A good quality colour copy should be 
retained on file should it be needed later for enforcement purposes such as removal from 
Canada. 
 
Scenario 4 
A foreign national appears at the POE and makes a claim for refugee protection. They are in 
possession of a genuine passport and birth certificate. As per A140(1) and refugee processing 
policy, the officer will seize the passport and birth certificate in order to carry out the purposes of 
the Act. The seizure is necessary to ensure compliance with conditions, including the appearance 
of the refugee claimant for the hearing before the Refugee Protection Division, and for the 
removal process if their claim is refused, withdrawn or abandoned. The officer will provide colour 
certified copies to the claimant in addition to the BSF698: Notice of Seizure of (a) Travel and/or 
Identity Document(s) and/or Other Thing(s).     
Scenario 5 
A foreign national comes to the attention of CBSA as a result of an encounter with a local police 
service. During their investigation, the officer(s) learns that the foreign national has remained in 
Canada beyond the period authorized and has neither applied for nor received any extensions to 
their temporary resident status. During their interview with the foreign national, the officer(s) learn 
that the foreign national is in possession of his genuine passport. The officer(s) conclude that 
there are reasonable grounds to believe that the seizure of the foreign national’s passport is 
necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act, as per A140(1). If a removal order is issued and 
becomes enforceable, CBSA requires the passport to enforce the removal order. The officer(s) 
will provide a certified copy of the passport in addition to the BSF698: Notice of Seizure of (a) 
Travel and/or Identity Document(s) and/or Other Thing(s). If no removal order is issued, officers 
must return the seized document.  
Enhanced Driver’s Licence    
An Enhanced Driver’s Licence (EDL) is a secure document which serves as both a licence to 
drive as well as an identity and Canadian citizenship document. The EDL is only valid as a 
Canadian citizenship document when travelling between Canada and the United States by land or 
water. When an individual presents an EDL at a POE, it is read by a radio-frequency identification 
(RFID) machine which then displays the status of the EDL. There is a possibility that the status 
displayed by the RFID machine contradicts information on the card (e.g. card appears valid, 
however RFID status states ‘cancelled’). It is also possible that an individual is travelling with an 
EDL that they should be not be travelling with (e.g. ‘cancelled’). If this occurs, officers should 
advise the individual(s) to attend the issuing authority of the EDL in order to resolve any 
outstanding issues. If an officer has any further concerns with regards to the EDL and its status, 
they should investigate as necessary, including contacting the issuing authority in order to 
determine whether a seizure of the EDL is necessary and appropriate. If a seized EDL is not 
required for the enforcement or administration of Canadian laws, an officer should return the 
document to the issuing authority with a memorandum outlining how it came into the possession 
of IRCC or the CBSA 
 
Please note that not all provinces and territories have an EDL program. Some 
provinces/territories have discontinued their EDL programs and others have announced a 


===== PAGE 30 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
30 
phasing out of their EDLs. As such, officers should confirm with the provincial or territorial 
authorities’ website if they have any doubts whether the EDLs are still valid for land and water 
travel between Canada and the U.S. 
 
8.3 Seizing documents from refugee claimants 
Although IRPA does not require that all documents in possesion of refugee claimants be seized, 
IRCC and CBSA officers should always consider seizing all passports, pertinent identification and 
travel documents carried by refugee claimants because the seizure may:  
 
expedite the identification of the person; 
 
assist in background checks; 
 
assist in identifying immediate family members; 
 
assist in verifying information provided in their Basis of Claim Form (BOC) 
 
ensure compliance; 
 
ensure that documents are not recycled; 
 
assist in removal should the refugee claim be unsuccessful. 
Where a genuine document is seized, certified true copies will be provided to these individuals as 
they may be required when seeking to access federal and provincial programs and services.  
Other documents, such as a driver’s license, may also be seized if it meets the criteria of A140(1).  
Officers must make three copies of all documentation seized and provide a copy to the 
Immigration Refugee Board. Officers must complete a BSF698 and provide a copy to the 
claimant.  
8.4 Seizing documents abroad 
Officers overseas may, following the examination of travel, identity and/or other document(s), 
have reasonable grounds to believe that the document(s) was/were fraudulently or improperly 
obtained or used, or that the seizure is necessary to prevent a document’s fraudulent or improper 
use or to carry out the purposes of the Act. 
However, Canadian officers may only enforce IRPA abroad to the extent that the host country has 
authorized it. 
The Vienna Conventions on Consular and Diplomatic relations impose an obligation on diplomats 
to respect the laws of the receiving state.  
Therefore, CBSA officers may seize documents abroad only if the host country has agreed to 
allow Canada to exercise its legislative authority under subsection 140(1) of the IRPA within the 
host’s territory. 
Where officers overseas have the authority to seize documents, they may also seize documents 
that are not issued by a Canadian authority. The approach to the question of seizure of 
documents will vary from location to location depending on the local environment in which the 
CBSA Liaison Officers (LO) and IRCC migration officers work, and the type of partnership or 
arrangements they have with the local enforcement agencies, airlines and other foreign-based 
officials with whom they interact. 


===== PAGE 31 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
31 
Officers should be aware that depending on local laws, the type of document or the type of 
arrangement with local agencies, officers may not have the authority to seize a document that 
was fraudulently or improperly used or obtained.  
Officers overseas must ensure that their actions are based on Canadian law and are not 
prohibited under the foreign law of the host country. Canadian legislation is insufficient to 
authorize a seizure where the actions are prohibited by the law of the host country. 
For example, documents should not be seized from an individual if the seizure impedes a host 
country’s ability to repatriate a third-country national. 
In the event a seizure is authorized, officers are instructed to complete form BSF698: Notice of 
Seizure of (a) Travel and/or Identity Documents(s) and/or Other Thing(s) for all travel and /or 
identity documents and/or other items seized under subsection 140(1) of IRPA.   
Note: CBSA Liaison Officers (LO) should contact International Operations Division via CBSA.INS-
SRI.ASFC@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca, if they require additional guidance. 
8.5 Documenting and tracking document seizures 
All things seized under A140(1) (e.g. travel and/or identity documents, conveyances, ticket stubs, 
employment information, etc.) must be recorded on the BSF698 Notice of Seizure of (a) Travel 
and/or Identity Document(s) and/or Other Thing(s) form. 
Officers must maintain a detailed record of any seizure action taken. This information may be 
useful in the event of a complaint, litigation, prosecution or enforcement action. It may be used as 
evidence in immigration proceedings, admissibility hearings, appeals and refugee hearings, or to 
enforce removal orders. 
The information concerning seizures must be maintained so that information can be retrieved 
quickly. At a minimum, the information recorded in the case of a seizure should include the 
following: 
 
lawful owner (where it can be determined); 
 
person from whom the document was seized; 
 
description of all documents seized; 
 
name and address of consignor (if applicable); 
 
name and address of consignee (if applicable); 
 
details of action taken as a result of seizure; 
 
details of any representations received; and 
 
final disposition of items seized. 
Protecting Evidence 
For information on maintaining the continuity of evidence for the purposes of prosecution under 
IRPA, refer to section 10.2 of this manual.

Global Case Management System (GCMS) 
GCMS is designated as the CBSA’s primary system for the tracking of travel and identity 
documents seized by the CBSA under A140(1). More specifically, seized documents must be 
tracked in the GCMS “Documents” tab. 
The record of seized documents in the GCMS “Documents” tab and supplemented by notes in the 
“Notes” tab, if necessary, must include information such as the biographical details visible in a 
document, document number, seizure date, reason for seizure, seizure status, held-at location, 
return date and other relevant facts if deemed necessary by the officer. 
A step-by-step guide can be accessed at the following wiki link: 
https://cbsawikiasfc.omega.dce-eir.net/display/FRPC/Document+Seizures+-
+Saisir+un+document 
Voiding a fraudulent Canadian visa 
There are no authorities in IRPA or in the Regulations to cancel a visa. However, officers may 
consider voiding a visa under certain circumstances, for instance if they encounter a fraudulent 
visa. 
A fraudulent Canadian visa may include a completely counterfeit document or an alteration of any 
part of a genuine document. It may also include an improperly obtained or improperly issued 
Canadian visa. 
The proper handling of fraudulent Canadian visas intercepted in Canada or abroad is required to 
prevent the fraudulent use of these documents, while preserving the passport or travel document 
that they are attached to. Officers may encounter fraudulent Canadian visas in a number of 
different situations, including but not limited to the following examples: 
 
Foreign national making a refugee claim at a Port of Entry or Inland; 
 
Foreign national seeking entry to Canada; 
 
Foreign national is granted an Allowed to Leave; 
 
Permanent resident or foreign national is arrested or detained under section A55; 
 
Foreign national is intercepted internationally prior to entry to Canada. 
Every effort must be made to preserve the travel document or passport that contains a fraudulent 
Canadian visa in its original condition, for evidentiary purposes, whether that be for a criminal 
investigation, an admissibility hearing or for removal purposes.  
When possible and where A140 requirements are met, officers should always consider seizure of 
the entire document first. If the seizure of the document containing the fraudulent Canadian visa 
is not possible or if the travel document is required for the return of the person concerned to their 
country of origin or to a third country, subject to local laws of the country (if intercepted abroad), 
then officers may consider marking the fraudulent Canadian visa. Unless otherwise provided for 
in the legislation of the issuing country, a standardized means of marking such document shall be 
used, using the wording “VOID”.   
Officers must record all events using GCMS and complete the BSF698. 
If an Inland Enforcement Officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a document was 
fraudulently or improperly obtained or used, the officer may exercise their authority pursuant to 
A140(1) to seize the document, however, should never mark the document without first 
pursuing proper analysis, as doing so may render the document invalid and/or prevent future 
removal efforts. 


===== PAGE 33 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
33 
In cases where it is not possible to seize a document that may have been fraudulently obtained or 
used, officers should, in consultation with the issuing authority (i.e. IRCC-Passport, the local 
issuing authority, the officer who issued the temporary resident visa or the local IRCC office, etc.), 
ensure that the document is cancelled promptly within the issuing system (i.e. GCMS).  
Genuine expired (i.e. Temporary Resident and/or Permanent Resident) visas may be annotated 
“Canceled without prejudice” in indelible black ink to deter re-use as raw material for fraudulent 
purposes. 
8.6 Document seizure and referral under section 23.2 of the Citizenship Act and sections 
28 and 30 of the Citizenship Regulations 
Under section 23.2 of the Citizenship Act (CA), IRCC officers may seize and detain documents if 
it is believed they were fraudulently or improperly obtained or used, or that the measure is 
necessary to prevent their fraudulent use. 
 
Pursuant to section 28 of the Citizenship Regulations (CR), the Minister may disclose to the 
CBSA information with respect to the seized document, including referral of the document itself to 
the Agency, for the purpose of the administration and enforcement of the IRPA. The CBSA may 
therefore retain the document for the period necessary to determine whether it is genuine or not. 
 
Pursuant to section 30 of the CR, if the Minister determines that the document was improperly or 
fraudulently obtained or used, the seized document must be detained for as long as is necessary 
for the administration of the laws of Canada, after which it will be returned to the issuing authority 
or disposed of in accordance with Canadian law. 
CBSA officers who receive documents from IRCC under the authority of section 28 of the CR 
should: 
 
Ensure that there is an IRPA nexus to the seized document; 
 
Transfer the documents to the appropriate area for further examination. Please refer to 
the Document Examination Referral and Communication Tree [PDF, 463 KB] (OBO-2021-
081) for more information. 
 
Ensure proper handling of the documents as per National Directive – Controls for Seized 
Travel and Identity Documents (PDF, 390 KB) and that chain of custody is maintained by 
recording the seizure in the appropriate system(s). 
In all cases and regardless of the outcome, the CBSA will return the document to the IRCC 
originator along with copies of the document analyst report and/or forensic examination report. 
They must also ensure a record of the transfer for continuity of evidence purposes is made and 
record the event in the applicable database(s). 
Under the authority of section 30 of the CR, if the examination indicates the document in question 
is fraudulent (altered through photo-substitution, page substitution, alterations and/or erasure of 
information, counterfeit, improperly obtained or issued or fantasy), the document must be 
detained for as long as is necessary for the administration of the laws of Canada. The forensic 
document examiner or document analyst will contact IRCC to inquire if further enforcement action 
is required. 
For clarity, there are a number of possible outcomes, as follows: 


===== PAGE 34 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
34 
 
Document is found to be fraudulent and document analyst or forensic document 
examination report(s) prepared. The CBSA & IRCC to be advised accordingly. Document 
is returned to IRCC for enforcement under the CA. The CBSA does not pursue IRPA 
enforcement. 
 
Document is found to be fraudulent and document analyst or forensic document 
examination report(s) prepared. The CBSA & IRCC to be advised accordingly. Document 
is returned to IRCC for enforcement under the CA. The CBSA pursues enforcement 
action under the IRPA once IRCC has completed enforcement action under the CA, and 
has released the document to the CBSA under S.30 of the CR. 
 
Document is found not to be fraudulent and document analyst or forensic document 
examination report(s) prepared. The CBSA & IRCC to be advised accordingly. Document 
is returned to IRCC, no enforcement action occurs. 
CBSA Seizures 
Once IRCC no longer requires the seized document for enforcement actions under the CA, 
authorized CBSA officials may then seize and detain the document if the provisions of 
section 140 of IRPA are met. Officers are to provide the person who provided the document with 
a copy of the seizure receipt BSF698 Notice of Seizure of (a)Travel and/or Identity Document(s) 
and/or Other Thing(s). Officers must also ensure a record of the transfer for continuity of evidence 
purposes is made, if applicable. 
8.7 Sending documents for analysis 
Document examination in the CBSA is a shared responsibility between the regional Document 
Analysis Units (DAUs), the National Document Centre (NDC) and the Forensic Document 
Examination (FDE) section. If officers require analysis of a physical travel or identity document for 
a determination of admissibility, investigation or for any other purpose, they should refer to the 
Document Examination Referral and Communication Tree found within Operational Bulletin 2021-
081 Document Examinations and Referrals. For a list of  document analysts or examiners by 
region, please refer to the Document Examination Contact List.  
 
For referrals to the NDC (from liaison officers or officers located in the Northern Ontario Region), 
a referral form is required and is available by contacting nat-intelligence-documents@cbsa-
asfc.gc.ca 
The referral form or the initial request for analysis to DAUs should contain the following 
information: 
•        the details about the document being sent; 
•        the date when the document analysis report is required; 
•        the purpose of analysis; 
•        the reason for the return of the document; 
•        the date, if known, for the return of the document; and 
•        the return address. 
If an officer requires that the original document be returned for a hearing or other purpose, the 
initial request for analysis or referral form should clearly state the date for which the document(s) 
is/are required. Physical documents requring analysis should always be sent through interoffice 
mail (if appopriate) or in a tracked courier package only after communicating with the NDC or the 
appropriate regional DAU. 


===== PAGE 35 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
35 
 
Upon completion of analysis, the document analyst will return the document analysis report  
(BSF265) to the requesting officer. Documents that are determined to be fraudulent will be 
retained by the NDC or regional DAU but if necessary may be made available to the officer who 
filed the request for analysis. 
 
8.8 Seizing ankle monitors and other GPS enabled devices 
CBSA officers may encounter individuals in possession of an ankle monitor or other GPS enabled 
devices used to monitor the individual’s whereabouts issued by the United States 
authorities.Officers may seize the device only if the seizure can be justified under subsection 
140(1) of the IRPA. If the device is seized, officers should fill out the BSF698 form to record and 
document the seizure. 
Devices that are abandoned or found by officers may be returned to the US authorities under the 
Statement of Mutual Understanding guidelines only if the individual who had the device did 
not make a claim for refugee status against the United States. In such cases, or for any other 
cases where advising the United States would not be appropriate officers may hold the device on 
a BSF 241 – Non-Monetary General Receipt form. 
8.9 Seizing vehicles 
The term “vehicle” is defined in the Regulations to include any means of transportation that may 
be used for transportation by water, land or air. This can include cars, trucks, tractors, buses, 
motorcycles, boats, airplanes and other modes of transportation. 
While A140(1) provides officers with the authority to seize a means of transportation, certain 
conditions must first be met.The officer must believe on reasonable grounds that the conveyance 
was fraudulently or improperly used or that the seizure is necessary to prevent the fraudulent or 
improper use or to carry out the purposes of the Act. For an officer to articulate the grounds to 
seize a means of transportation, there must be a logical purpose that is directly correlated with 
the IRPA, such as an A44(1) report alleging an inadmissibility, an admissibility hearing, a removal 
or criminal charges. In other words, there needs to be an intention to pursue an enforcement 
action. 
Certain circumstances should occur for a seizure of a vehicle to be reasonable. In most cases a 
seizure of a conveyance will arise at a port of entry while carrying out the purposes of the Act.  
Officers should be aware that seizing a means of transportation in the inland enforcement context 
will be rare and will typically happen when an offence has occurred that may lead to charges 
under IRPA. Prior to the seizure of a vehicle in this situation, Criminal Investigations Division 
should be consulted.         
Where the vehicle has more than one component (e.g., a car pulling a trailer), each is treated as 
a separate vehicle. If they are seized, separate notices (BSF698 and reports) are required for 
each vehicle. In the following scenarios, it may be appropriate for a CBSA officer to consider 
seizing  a vehicle: 
 
Where a vehicle is used to drop an undocumented, or otherwise inadmissible, person on the 
U.S. side of the border in order to assist the person in eluding examination, and/or picks up 
the person on the Canadian side without the person appearing for examination. 
 
Where the status of a person in the vehicle, who does not have a passport or a visa as 
required, is withheld or purposely misrepresented at a Port of Entry to prevent a proper 
examination. However, BSOs should remember that not all misrepresentation will lead to a 
vehicle seizure. For instance, under section R22, persons who have claimed refugee 
protection, if disposition of their claim is pending, and protected persons may be exempt from 


===== PAGE 36 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
36 
the application of the misrepresentation provision. A vehicle seizure in those cases might not 
be warranted.  
 
Where, during an examination, it is discovered that the driver of a vehicle allowed an 
undocumented person to exit the vehicle before the point of examination and that person 
walked to the POE to report separately for an examination; and where it is established that 
the driver was seeking entry to Canada but knowingly withheld documents and any 
connection with the arrival of the pedestrian who is inadmissible.  
 
Where the driver or owner of a vehicle knowingly brings refugee claimants to the border and 
receives remuneration for these services (lawyers, consultants, or others). 
It may NOT be appropriate for a CBSA officer to seize a vehicle where the driver or owner 
knowingly brings refugee claimants to the border without receiving any remuneration for these 
services (family members, friends, NGOs). Officers should consider all of the relevant information 
in each individual case and ultimately be mindful as to the purpose of any seizure and any 
potential enforcement action along the immigration enforcement continuum.  
Since a vehicle may be seized after the fact, officers should immediately take note of the vehicle’s 
identity numbers and markings in case it leaves without permission or the seizure cannot take 
place because of danger. This information can subsequently be used to link the vehicle to a 
fraudulent or improper use if it is located at a later date. If the seizure cannot be completed, the 
officer should report the incident to the CBSA Regional Office and to the CBSA Regional Director. 
The matter should be turned over to the RCMP for investigation and appropriate action. 
Note: Only the CBSA is designated to seize a means of transportation under A140. 
8.10 Seizure of commercial vehicles 
Subsection A148(2) provides CBSA officers with the authority to detain, seize or forfeit a vehicle 
of a transporter that fails to comply with an obligation under IRPA. The delegated authority to 
seize a commercial vehicle under A148(2) is identified in the Designation of Officers and 
Delegation of Authority manual. 
For additional information on the procedures relating to seizures of vehicles or assets of 
commercial transporters pursuant to A148(2), refer to ENF 15, Obligations of Transporters.  
8.11 Notice of seizure  
The provisions related to the notice of seizure require that written notification be provided to the 
person from whom the thing was seized, and if this person is not the lawful owner, reasonable 
efforts must be made to identify and notify the lawful owner of the seizure. With regards to travel 
and identity documents, notification to the bearer of the document will likely be considered as a 
valid notice of seizure pursuant to subsection 253(1) of the IRPR, without the need to notify the 
country of issuance. 
If the person from whom a thing was seized is not the lawful owner, the officer should ask the 
person from whom it was seized to identify the owner or owners and request that they complete a 
declaration. An officer should document the steps taken to determine ownership and notify the 
lawful owner and, where appropriate, may also consider completing a statutory declaration. 
In the case of a seized means of transportation, the lawful owner could include:  
 
the registered owner who is not the person from whom the means of transportation is seized; 
 
the firm that owns the vehicle that has been leased or rented. 


===== PAGE 37 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
37 
An officer who seizes a thing is required to issue a BSF698 and to include the reasons for the 
seizure as well as how/where to make an application for its return. 
If a person from whom a thing has been seized desires to contact legal counsel, the officer should 
make every effort to facilitate this. This may be as simple as providing the individual the 
opportunity and means to make a phone call. Officers should record in their notebook whether the 
person contacted legal counsel. 
8.12 Reporting the seizure of a vehicle 
Following the seizure of a vehicle, the officer will place the vehicle in CBSA’s custody, provide 
notice of seizure pursuant to R253(1) and prepare a report. CBSA officers should provide the 
following information in their report following the seizure of a vehicle: 
 
the name and other relevant biographical data of the driver and passengers; 
 
the role of all the persons involved in the case; 
 
the vehicle information (i.e., plates, description); 
 
information on the owner of the vehicle, including permission of use if the owner is not the 
operator (the facts will support the evidence in the courts); 
 
whether it is a rented vehicle (copy of the rental agreement); 
 
the point of disembarkation and entry as well as the destination in Canada; 
 
details about passengers disembarking immediately before arriving at the Canadian border; 
 
presentation of passengers and intent (i.e., failure to report for examination); 
 
misrepresentation, false or misleading information, deception, stealth; 
 
details about passport, visa, travel documents and other relevant documents or the lack 
thereof; 
 
itinerary, plans or details of events; 
 
specific destination or addresses; 
 
estimate of the value of the vehicle or things seized. 
The officer's report must be detailed and accurate as it may be used for evidence in courts. The 
officer's report may also be used for recommendations to the Minister regarding the disposition of 
the seized vehicle or to determine the value of the vehicle. The officer's notes should support the 
decision to seize. Reports that are inaccurate or are incomplete may lead to a decision to return 
the seized vehicle. 
For information on note-taking, refer to ENF 7, Immigration Investigations and IRPA s.55 
Arrests/Detention. 
The officer who seizes a vehicle should immediately report the basic information by e-mail to their 
Regional Director according to established regional produres. This will allow the Minister’s 
delegate to respond quickly to inquiries made within a day or two following the seizure. A written 
report and the documentary evidence that is available at the time should be sent by fax or 
encrypted email to the officer’s Regional Director within three business days.

8.13 Release of information 
Under some circumstances, there may be authority for an officer to release information obtained 
as a result of a seizure. IRCC and CBSA may release personal information obtained as a result of 
a seizure to the RCMP for investigations under the Act and Regulations. Such release is 
consistent with the purpose of subsection 8(2)(a) of the Privacy Act.  
IRCC and the CBSA may also release personal information to an investigative body specified in 
the Privacy Regulations for the purpose of enforcing any law of Canada or a province or carrying 
out a lawful investigation. The investigative body must make a written request, which specifies the 
purpose and describes the information to be disclosed pursuant to paragraph 8(2)(e) of the 
Privacy Act.  
There may be other situations where the release of information obtained as result of a seizure 
may be authorized under the Access to Information Act and Privacy Act. The officer is 
encouraged to seek the advice of their regional Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP) 
coordinators before considering such options. 
 
9. Procedure: Mail and courier search and seizures under IRPA  
Subsection 42(1) of the Canada Post Corporation Act states that all mail arriving in Canada from 
a place outside Canada that contains or is suspected to contain anything the importation of which 
is prohibited, controlled or regulated under the Customs Act or any other Act of Parliament shall 
be submitted to a customs officer. 
The objective of mail searches and seizures is to take out of circulation counterfeit, altered and 
improperly obtained travel and identity documents. Documents found in international mail may be 
relevant to prosecutions or enforcement actions under the Immigration and Refugee Protection 
Act.  
Officers involved in examining, seizing and caring for items seized in mail and courier systems 
should strive for minimal impairment of privacy and be mindful of the responsibilities inherent in 
their authority. Officers should not examine or seize mail on behalf of any other agency or 
department, unless legally authorized to do so. 
9.1 CBSA inspection procedures for international mail 
International mail arrives in Canada from other countries by marine, rail, highway, and air modes 
of transportation. The mail is received at Canada Post processing facilities where it is sorted for 
movement within Canada. International mail is then directed for CBSA processing to one of three 
CBSA mail centres, all located within Canada Post facilities in Vancouver, Toronto, and Montreal.  
The CBSA reviews all classes of mail received from Canada Post to identify and segregate items 
that require further examination. The review includes priority post, first class, registered and 
parcel mail.  
For complete information on conducting a postal examination, see CBSA Enforcement Manual 
Part 4 Chapter 12. 
9.2 CBSA inspection procedures for shipments in the Courier Low Value Shipment 
Program 
Due to the high-volume, low-value nature of goods imported in the courier stream, the CBSA has 
streamlined the reporting, release, and accounting procedures for certain courier shipments via 
the Courier Low Value Shipments (CLVS) Program. According to these procedures, authorized 
couriers are allowed to present a single Cargo Release List (CRL) documenting all low-value 


===== PAGE 39 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
39 
shipments (i.e., valued at $3,300 CAD or less) onboard a conveyance, instead of having to 
present separate cargo control documents. The single report, the CRL, must be submitted to the 
CBSA before the conveyance arrives in Canada within specified modal timeframes. 
For further information pertaining to Courier Examinations, see CBSA Enforcement Manual Part 4 
Chapter 13. 
9.3 How mail seizures work 
When a CBSA officer examines a parcel containing suspicious documents or other documents or 
things that might be subject to seizure under A140(1), the CBSA officer will generally detain the 
parcel until it can be examined further. When deciding whether there are reasonable grounds for 
a seizure under A140(1), the officer must take into account the totality of the circumstances, 
including the following: 
 
Whether the information upon which the grounds for seizure are based is compelling? 
 
Whether the information is credible? 
 
Whether the information is corroborated? 
9.4 Responsibilities of CBSA officers with respect to mail seizures 
CBSA officers conducting mail seizures are responsible for the following: 
 
treating every seized document and/or any other item seized as a potential piece of evidence. 
The packaging itself may also constitute important evidence and is worthy of the same 
consideration; 
 
maintaining records of seizure, including officer notebooks, as they may ultimately be subject 
to scrutiny in court and/or other enforcement proceedings; 
 
justifying their actions in the examination and seizure of international mail in the event of a 
prosecution, enforcement measure, complaint, audit, investigation, or other review; 
 
notifying the lawful owner of seized documents and disposing of them in accordance with the 
Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. 
With respect to enforcement measures, the integrity of seizure procedures is paramount to 
ensuring proper control, accounting and continuity of evidence. 
9.5 Documenting and tracking seizures 
Officers at CBSA mail centres should document seizures pursuant to A140 on the BSF698 form. 
According to local procedures, the BSF698 and the seized items may be sent to the appropriate 
inland enforcement office for further processing, such as entering the seizure information in 
GCMS. Officers should forward the items seized and form to the inland enforcement office using 
registered mail or Purolator. The tracking number and seizure information should be recorded 
according to existing procedures. 
It is imperative that officers maintain a detailed record of any seizure action taken. This 
information may be useful in the event of a complaint, litigation, prosecution or enforcement 
action. It may also be used as evidence in immigration proceedings, admissibility hearings, 
appeals and refugee hearings, or to enforce removal orders. 
Where the examination site does not have computer equipment available for use by the officer, 
work sheets and seizure forms should be completed manually. Manually completed sheets and

ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
40 
forms should be recorded according to local procedures at the first available opportunity. The 
information concerning seizures must be maintained so that information can be retrieved quickly. 
At a minimum, the information recorded in the case of a seizure should include the following: 
 
lawful owner (where it can be determined); 
 
person from whom the document was seized; 
 
date and time the package was referred by the initial CBSA officer for further inspection; 
 
the referral information (e.g., log numbers, courier company labels); 
 
date, time, and place where examination of the package commenced; 
 
date, time, and place where examination of the package was completed; 
 
number of items in package; 
 
description of all items seized; 
 
name and address of consignor; 
 
name and address of consignee; 
 
whether full or partial seizure; 
 
if a partial seizure, date/time/place package returned for customs processing; 
 
details of action taken as a result of seizure; 
 
details of any representations received; 
 
final disposition of items seized; and 
 
the seizure control number. 
9.6 Security, storage, and labeling of items seized 
Rigorous standards of control, including appropriate secure storage, labeling, and regular 
monitoring of any seizure is mandatory. Seized items stored locally will be subject to normal file 
control practices, including inventory, review and purging. Officers and support clerks should be 
able, at any time, to determine the location and responsible officer for any seized item. 
Appropriate receipts for transmittal of seized items must also be carefully maintained.  
A copy of the BSF698 Notice of Seizure of (a) Travel and/or Identity Document(s) and/or Other 
Thing(s) should be securely attached to the envelope used to store seized items and the seizure 
should be recorded according to local procedures.  
9.7 Split seizures 
Splitting seizures for any reason should generally be avoided. If a seizure consists of several 
items, they should all be kept together in the original seizure envelope until final disposition. 
There may be exceptions to this, such as where multiple documents are seized relating to several 


===== PAGE 41 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
41 
different case files. In this instance, the seized documents would be individually forwarded to the 
respective case files. 
While seized items under IRPA should be documented on the BSF698 form, items seized 
pursuant to the Customs Act should be recorded on the appropriate CBSA form. 
9.8 Partial seizures 
In a partial seizure, one or more document or other thing may be seized under IRPA while the 
rest of the items in the parcel may be returned to the customs process. If one or more documents 
or things are removed, the remaining goods should be re-sealed in the package and the officer 
can return them to the customs process. On release by a CBSA officer, the package may then be 
returned to the course of post. Where a partial seizure occurs, notification should be provided as 
per the Regulations.  
9.9 Notification of owner  
The Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations require that officers effecting a seizure, full 
or partial, of items from international mail must provide notification to the rightful owner in all 
cases.  
In cases where ownership of seized goods cannot be readily established, for example where the 
importer's or exporter's full name and address cannot be determined from the labels or other 
information accompanying the seized goods, officers should make reasonable alternative efforts 
to identify the owner. Efforts to locate the owner and the results at each stage should be recorded 
in detail on the seizure file and local mail seizure administrative databases. Where an owner is 
identified, written notification of mail seizures should be made using the BSF698. Brief grounds 
for seizure specific to each item listed on the form should be included in the "Reason and/or 
details" portion.  
If the goods clearly constitute items such as blank identity documents or counterfeit passports, 
the officer can conclude that there is no lawful owner. In some cases, state-issued documents 
such as passports should be returned to the issuing authority. Officers should not notify an 
issuing state in cases where a document was seized from a refugee claimant when such 
notification would alert the country to the presence of the refugee claimant in Canada.  
9.10 Returning items to the customs process 
Where an officer does not establish reasonable grounds for seizure, the package should be 
returned without delay to the customs inspection process. An imported package is considered to 
be in the customs secondary process unless seized by a CBSA officer for immigration purposes.  
There is no requirement to record reasons in support of a decision to return a package to the 
customs process. A minimum of information should be recorded about released packages as may 
be required for tracking the item, for measurement of workload or other legitimate administrative 
purpose. No photocopies, images, transcriptions or other record of the contents of such packages 
are to be retained. 
10. Procedure: Custody and Liability of Seized Things 
10.1 Custody of seized items 
R252 requires an officer who seizes a thing under A140(1) to place it without delay in the custody 
of the Department/Agency. IRCC and CBSA officers are designated to seize documents or other 
things under A140 while only the CBSA is delegated to seize a means of transportation under 
A140. It is sufficent for IRCC or CBSA officials to seize the items to consider them as being in the 


===== PAGE 42 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
42 
custody of the respective Department/Agency. Seized items should be stored in a protected 
holding area with restricted access. If the RCMP seizes anything under the Immigration and 
Refugee Protection Act, they are required to turn it over to a CBSA officer.   
Storage of seized vehicles should be arranged locally in consultation with the regional CBSA 
office when necessary. The storage area should afford reasonable protection against damages, 
theft and accidents. 
If a file transfer occurs between IRCC and the CBSA, custody of the seized document or other 
thing will also change from one organization to the other. Means of transportation will always 
remain in the custody of the CBSA. 
10.2 Protecting evidence  
An officer may be required to testify in court that a document or other item seized has remained 
unchanged since it came into their possession: in other words, that the continuity of evidence has 
been maintained. Whatever evidence comes into an officer's possession, the officer must note 
the date, time and place on the case file and in a notebook.  
To maintain the continuity of evidence for the purposes of prosecution under the Immigration and 
Refugee Protection Act or the Criminal Code, officers must ensure that seized items are kept in a 
secure area and handled by a minimum number of persons.  
Every effort should be made to preserve documentary evidence in the same condition as it was 
collected. It is also strongly advised to keep direct handling of orginal documents to an absolute 
minimum (if they are to be repeatedly referred to they should be individually placed inside copy 
safe sheet protectors or transparent sleeves.) 
At no time should documentary evidence be placed beneath something on which writing can 
occur, such as on a desk or attached to a clipboard, etc. This will add indented impressions to the 
douments, which may not only impact the examination of the document(s) but risk leaving 
indentations of sensitive Agency information. Evidence containers should be marked for 
identification before the documentary evidence is placed inside to avoid the addition of indented 
impressions. 
The evidence shall not be folded, torn, stamped, hole-punched, stapled, marked or touched 
unnecessarily. Avoid using staples, tweezers, binder clips and other such devices on the 
documents. Furthermore, no additional writing should be added to the evidence for record 
keeping purposes, the documents should not be fed through the automatic document feeder on a 
photocopier. Copies should be made by manual placement of documents on the glass plate. 
The officer should:  
 
make a photocopy of the document and stamp “certified true copy” on each page and write 
their initials, the time and the date;  
 
write a description on the envelope of the contents, the name and file number of the person 
concerned, the officer's initials and the time and date; and  
 
seal the evidence in an envelope, write their initials across the envelope seal and secure it 
with transparent tape. 
If an authorized officer needs to remove and examine evidence from the envelope, the officer 
must repeat the steps just described above when placing the evidence back in the envelope. If an 
officer only needs to refer to a document, the officer should refer to the certified true copy on file.  
If a peace officer requires possession of the document from the immigration file for prosecution, 
generally, this would be done under a subpoena or a production order issued by the Court. An 


===== PAGE 43 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
43 
officer should verify the contents of the envelope with the peace officer against the certified true 
copy on file. Officers may contact CBSA Case Management should assistance be required.  
An officer should make a note of these procedures, place the note on file for future reference and 
enter the information in the official notebook.  
10.3 Liability for damage to property  
If a search results in damage to the traveller's vehicle or baggage, an officer must prepare a 
report indicating the extent of the damage and other relevant details of the examination. For 
regulations and policy for handling damage claims against the Crown, see the Guidelines on 
Claims and Ex Gratia Payments. When a search brings no results, and the search caused 
damage to the person's belongings, it is policy to return the conveyance or item to its original 
state. When it is apparent that items may be damaged during a search because of their state of 
repair or fragility, the officer should take before and after photographs of the items, to avoid the 
CBSA from having to pay for damages unrelated to the search.   
10.4 CBSA liability for damage to a vehicle 
CBSA officers who seize a vehicle should make a careful inventory of any damage that the 
vehicle has and should ask the person from whom the vehicle was seized or the owner to give 
written acknowledgement of the inventory, if they are present at the time. 
A vehicle that is seized remains in the custody of the CBSA until all legislative requirements for its 
return or disposal have been complied with. 
The CBSA may be liable for any damage caused to a vehicle in its custody depending on the 
factual circumstances of each case. Any damages caused to a vehicle while under seizure should 
be reported to the Regional office and to the Regional Director for appropriate assessment. 
Owners of a damaged seized vehicle may seek redress under a number of different laws.  
11. Procedure: Disposition and return of seized things 
11.1 
Return of seized things 
Sections 254 and 255 of the IRPR outline the requirements to determine when a seized thing can 
be returned to its lawful owner or to a person from whom it was seized.  
Both the lawful owner and the person from whom the thing was seized have 60 days to submit an 
application for the return of the seized thing, and the timeline begins upon the notice of seizure 
(and not the date of the seizure itself). If the notification is sent by mail, it is deemed to have been 
provided seven days after the day on which the notice was mailed. Applications for the return of a 
seized thing can be made by using the BSF699 form. 
R256 states that should both the lawful owner and the person from whom the thing was seized 
make concurrent applications, the lawful owner’s application will be processed first. If the 
application of the lawful owner is granted, the application received from the person from whom 
the thing was seized will not be processed. 
The regulations require that an application for return must be made if the thing was seized on the 
grounds of: 
 
being improperly or fraudulently obtained; 
 
being improperly or fraudulently used; and 
 
to prevent improper or fraudulent use. 
Seizures made on the grounds of being necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act are the 
only types of seizure that cannot be returned upon application. A thing seized on the ground that 


===== PAGE 44 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
44 
it was necessary to carry out the purposes of the Act can only be returned if the seizure is no 
longer necessary for those purposes. 
Once an application for return has been submitted, the regulations require that a decision on the 
application for return be provided in writing to the applicant as soon as feasible which is 
understood as being something that must be done soon, taking circumstances into account. 
The regulations provide that the things seized shall be returned to the person from whom they 
were seized (R254) or their lawful owner (R255) as follows, provided an application for return has 
been submitted: 
Regulations 
Explanation 
R254(2)  Return – Improperly or fraudulently 
obtained 
Applicant must demonstrate that they were 
entitled to have that thing in their possession 
at the time of seizure and that they are still 
entitled to it. 
R254(3) Return – Improperly or fraudulently 
used 
Applicant must demonstrate that they did not 
participate in the fraudulent or improper use of 
the thing. They must also demonstrate that 
they were entitled to have the thing in their 
possession at the time of seizure and that 
they are still entitled to it. 
R254(4) Return – Prevention of improper or 
fraudulent use 
Applicant must demonstrate that the seizure is 
no longer necessary to prevent its fraudulent 
or improper use. They must also demonstrate 
that they were entitled to have the thing in 
their possession at the time of seizure and 
that they are still entitled to it. 
R255(2) Return – Improperly of fraudulenty 
obtained 
Applicant must demonstrate that at the time of 
the seizure they were the lawful owner and 
that they are still the lawful owner of the thing 
seized. 
R255(3) Return – Improperly or fraudulently 
used 
The applicant must demonstrate that they did 
not participate in the fraudulent or improper 
use of the thing, and that at the time of 
seizure, they were the lawful owner and that 
they are still the lawful owner of the thing 
seized. They also need to demonstrate that 
they exercised all reasonable care to satisfy 
themselves that the person to whom they 
gave possession of the thing was not likely to 
fraudulently or improperly use it. 
R255(4) Return – Prevention of improper or 
fraudulent use 
The applicant must demonstrate that the 
seizure is no longer necessary to prevent the 
fraudulent or improper use of the thing. They 
must also demonstrate that they were the 
lawful owner of the thing at the time of seizure 
and that they are still the lawful owner.

Note: Following a seizure made under IRPA, a CBSA inland office may hold travel or identity 
documents of foreign nationals awaiting their permanent residency. Once the permanent 
residence application has received stage 2 approval, IRCC will contact the CBSA office where 
the documents are being held to request that the travel/identity documents be sent to the 
nearest IRCC office responsible for the foreign national’s landing. After receiving this request, 
the CBSA inland office will release the documents to IRCC following established procedures. 
For additional information, please consult IRCC’s operational bulletin OB 553 – Obtaining 
passports or travel documents for landing from the Canada Border Services Agency and 
officer’s discretion to waive the passport requirement for landing purposes. 
 
11.2 Sale or destruction of seized things other than documents 
R258 sets out the conditions under which a thing that was seized under A140 may be disposed 
of. The Instrument of Delegation and Designation (IL 3) describes the powers that have been 
delegated and identifies the level of delegation. Things that are seized may be disposed of only 
as provided in the Regulations and following the decision of an officer who has been delegated to 
exercise that authority. 
 
Sale or disposal of seized vehicles 
Vehicles are to be processed as any other seized things and may be returned to the person from 
whom they were seized or their lawful owner if the criteria set out in R254 or R255 are met.  
Because vehicles often have a high market value, many of the delegations for the disposition of 
seized vehicles are at the managerial level. Many situations will require advice from the CBSA’s 
Legal Services. 
Following the seizure of a vehicle, the officer will: 
 
place it in the custody of the CBSA; 
 
identify the owner; 
 
give written notice and reasons; 
 
prepare a report; and 
 
review the case in light of R254 or R255. 
If the vehicle is not returned, the full report on the vehicle seizure is forwarded to the Regional 
Director of Enforcement, District Director or Regional Director General. Samples of reports, 
memos and letters that may be used in these circumstances can be found in: 
 
Appendix A:  Sample for a summary/report for a seized vehicle (from the owner, borrowed or 
rented) 
 
Appendix B: Sample memorandum to DG for decision on application for the return of a seized 
vehicle. 
 
Appendix C: Sample of a decision to return a seized vehicle 
 
Appendix D: Sample of a notice of decision and reasons – return of a seized vehicle 


===== PAGE 46 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
46 
Sale or destruction of seized things other than a document 
R258(1) provides for objects of monetary value (other than documents) to be sold. In cases 
where an object has no monetary value or the costs of the sale would exceed the monetary value 
of the object, the object is destroyed.  
11.3 Notice of decision 
An officer is required to notify the person in writing of the decision with respect to applications 
made under R254 or R255 for the return of seized objects and provide reasons. 
11.4 Decision by the Minister not to return a seized thing 
If the decision following review of an application for return is not to return a seized thing, then it 
remains in  IRCC or CBSA custody (depending on the nature of the seizure and the item seized) 
or is disposed of in accordance with R258(1) for things other than documents, and R258(3) for 
seized documents.  
Examples of things that would not be returned are: 
 
fraudulent documents (photo-substituted passports, travel documents); 
 
lost or stolen items; 
 
altered documents (passports with illegal alterations, pages missing); 
 
counterfeit money; 
 
iIlegally obtained driver’s licence, social security or credit cards. 
11.5 Suspension of sale 
R258(2) provides that an object should not be sold during the 15-day period following notification 
that the object would not be returned, or before a final decision is made in any judicial proceeding 
in Canada relating to its seizure or return.  
11.6 Return of documents 
When returning a document, an officer should record the details on the file and complete the  the  
form BSF 699 Application for the Return of (a) Seized Travel and/or Identity Document(s) and/or 
Other Thing(s) to show that the document has been returned. For example:  
“Passport number 12345 issued in Norway was returned to the holder John Doe, date of birth, on 
27 February 2002.” 
Section R258(3) requires that if a seized document is not returned, it shall be retained for as long 
as is necessary for the administration or enforcement of Canadian laws, after which it is governed 
by the applicable laws relating to the disposal of public archives.  
Before retiring a file, an officer should return other documents (such as driver’s licences) to the 
issuing authority with a memorandum outlining how they came into the possession of  IRCC or 
the CBSA. 
11.7 Disposing of fraudulent documents 
R258(3) prescribes that the seized document is retained as long as it is necessary for the 
administration or enforcement of Canadian law. Therefore, an officer should not return the 
following documents to the person from whom they were seized:  


===== PAGE 47 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
47 
 
altered documents (examples of alterations include photo-substitution and page substitution) 
and alterations of variable mentions (such as date of birth or name) or erasures, and  
unauthorized additions (counterfeit entry and/or exit stamps and/or visas); 
 
counterfeit documents; 
 
improperly obtained or issued documents; and 
 
fantasy or fictitious documents. 
Known or suspected fraudulent documents, including documents containing counterfeit visas or 
stamps and all altered or fantasy documents, should be forwarded to a regional DAU via 
interoffice mail or a tracked courier package. Officers in the Northern Ontario Region should send 
the documents to the National Document Centre (NDC) by the same means. As for liaison 
officers, they should send fraudulent documents to the NDC by diplomatic bags. Please ensure to 
inform the DAU or the NDC by email that a package will be arriving and indicate whether or not 
analysis is required (see section 8.7 of this manual for additional information on how to send 
documents for analysis). 
 
For further information about the National Document Centre including its published alerts, 
bulletins and communiqués, please refer to the Atlas page: http://atlas/tb-dgv/about-sujet/tp-pv/to-

12. Procedure: Fingerprinting and the Collection of Biometric Information 
12.1 Authority to collect biometric information  
A10.01 and A16(2) provide the legal authority to collect biometric information of foreign nationals 
making a claim, application or request under the IRPA, while section 12.001 of the IRPR indicates 
where the collection of biometrics may be done. 
The collection of biometric information includes, but is not limited to, foreign nationals who are 
applying: 
 
to enter Canada; 
 
for visas or other documents at a visa office;  
 
for permanent residence in Canada;  
 
to vary or cancel conditions imposed; or 
 
for refugee protection. 
A16(3) provides authority to fingerprint a permanent resident or foreign national who is arrested, 
detained, subject to an examination or a removal order to establish their identity or compliance 
with the Act.  
These sections provide the authority for an officer to collect fingerprints and place an obligation 
on the individual to provide them; however, this does not provide the authority to use force to 
compel an individual to meet this obligation. If necessary, an officer may use reasonable force to 
effect an arrest or detention as described under A55(2) or A55(3) but this does not extend to the 
collection of fingerprints. 


===== PAGE 48 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
48 
Although an officer cannot physically compel an individual to provide fingerprints, an officer may 
pursue administrative options under IRPA that are appropriate to the circumstances. Before 
pursuing these options, an officer should take steps to ensure the individual understands the legal 
obligation to provide fingerprints and the potential consequences for failing to meet this obligation.  
Should the individual continue to refuse to provide fingerprints, the administrative options 
available include: 
 
allowing the individual to withdraw their application to enter Canada at a POE as per R42 
 
preparing an inadmissibility report based on the individual’s non-compliance and/or other 
inadmissibilities  
 
authorizing entry into Canada for the purpose of further examination as per A23 
 
directing the person to leave Canada at a POE as per R40 
The failure to provide fingerprints may constitute an offence under A124(1)(a) of the IRPA. If 
appropriate, an officer should consult with CBSA’ Criminal Investigations Division (CID) regarding 
the individual failing to comply with a condition or obligation imposed under the Act.  
R12.1 specifies the claims, applications or requests requiring the collection of biometrics. 
R12.3(b) provides for the biometric information that is to be collected; photograph and 
fingerprints.   
Biometric collection is mandatory for foreign nationals who are: 
 
applying for a temporary resident visa, work permit, or study permit; 
 
citizens of a country or territory on the prescribed country list; and 
 
14 to 79 years of age. 
Biometrics are collected from all applicants who are making an asylum claim in Canada and are 
14 years of age and over. 
Note: The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) does not accept the fingerprints of any child 
aged 12 years or younger.   
 
Privacy notice  
 
In accordance with Treasury Board Policy on Data Protection and Privacy, where a department 
collects personal information directly from individuals, it is required to inform individuals of the 
following:  
 
1. the purpose of the collection;  
2. whether the collection is voluntary or required by law;  
3. any possible consequences of refusal to respond;  
 
4. that the individual to whom the information pertains has rights to access and protection under 
the Privacy Act; and  
5. that the personal information is retained in a Personal Information Bank (PIB). 
 
Accordingly, a Privacy Notice must be posted at all LiveScan automated fingerprint systems sites.

12.2 Biometrics Expansion 
The Biometrics Expansion program has expanded biometric (fingerprints and digital photographs) 
screening and verification to all temporary resident visa (TRV) applicants, work permit (WP), 
study permit (SP), temporary resident permit (TRP) applicants and all Permanent Resident (PR) 
applicants.  
Citizens of the United States are exempt from biometric verification unless they are 
applying for permanent residence. Also, foreign nationals issued a visitor record at a POE will 
not be subject to biometric enrolment.  
For further details, please refer to the Biometrics Toolkit. 
12.3 Taking fingerprints 
Officers are to use LiveScan kiosks wherever they are available. Ink and roll prints are only to be 
used when a LiveScan kiosk is not available and officers are processing applications in the 
Refugee or Criminal Charges workflows (please refer to section 12.5 for the description of each 
workflow). For applications in the TR/PR Enrolment Workflow, the collection of fingerprints may 
be overridden. For information on where the biometrics may be taken, please refer to section 
12.001 of the IRPR. 
LiveScan is an automated fingerprint system designed to capture fingerprints in an efficient and 
accurate manner without the use of ink. LiveScan records ten-print 'plain' fingerprint impressions, 
ten-print 'rolled' fingerprint impressions, palm prints, writer's palm prints (side of the hand), and 
client demographic information. LiveScan also records the subject's digital photo, which is 
electronically printed on the fingerprint form. The fingerprint information is then encrypted and 
transmitted to the RCMP’s Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS) for search of 
registered convictions and charges. 
LiveScan is an enforcement initiative that enhances capacity to electronically transmit biometric 
fingerprint data to the RCMP/HQ, improve fingerprint quality, reduce response times, and 
safeguard fingerprint information. 
Please refer to the LiveScan User Guide or the LiveScan Quick Reference Card for additional 
information. 
12.4 Obtaining access to LiveScan/CardScanner 
Before gaining access to the LiveScan/Cardscanner you must complete a form: 
 
Step 1: Obtain the  LiveScan/CardScanner Acceptance Form by contacting your Regional 
Coordinator or the LiveScan team at livescan@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca.  
 
Step 2: The Supervisor/Superintendent will email the following to the Regional Coordinator: 
- 
First/Last name; 
- 
User ID; 
- 
Name of the site where access is required; and 
- 
Scanned copies of the forms 
 
Step 3: The Regional Coordinator will contact the LiveScan Team at livescan@cbsa-
asfc.gc.ca. Upon receipt of the required information, the LiveScan team will grant system 
access. 
 
Please refer to the LiveScan User Guide or the LiveScan Quick Reference Card for additional 
information.

12.5 LiveScan kiosk workflows 
The LiveScan kiosk contains the following workflows: 
 
Criminal Record Check Workflow - (CAR-N) 
This workflow is a useful tool in determining identity or admissibility. Results obtained through the 
use of the Criminal Record Check Workflow are accurate and conclusive because they are based 
on a biometric match as opposed to a simple name and date of birth match. The Criminal Record 
Check Workflow can be used to confirm a CPIC or NCIC result.  
 
 
Criminal Charges Workflow – (CAR-Y) 
The Criminal Charges Workflow is used when a person is charged with a criminal offence.  
Currently at the CBSA, the Criminal Charges Workflow is generally used by criminal investigators 
only. Officers may be required to use Criminal Charges when submitting prints on behalf of other 
law enforcement partners. 
 
 
Deportee Workflow  
This workflow is used when a person is being deported or removed. 
 
       
NOTE: Officers should be taking the fingerprints of all:  
 
escorted removals (all escorted removals under a deportation order, including those 
under a deemed deportation order); 
 
deportees with a criminal record; and 
 
deportees who do not have fingerprints on file. 
 
 
Refugee Workflow  
The Refugee Workflow is used to capture the biographic data, facial image and fingerprints of all 
refugee applicants over the age of 14. This information is captured for two purposes: to query the 
AFIS database for registered convictions/charges and/or a previous refugee claim and to store 
the fingerprint set in the AFIS refugee database. The RCMP retains refugee fingerprints until the 
claimant becomes a Canadian citizen.   
 
 
Civil Workflow 
All CBSA sites have the authority to submit cases using the Civil Workflow. The Civil Workflow is 
used to capture fingerprints for civil purposes such as security clearances, employee background 
verifications, volunteer screenings, etc. All results will go to the Personnel Security Screening Unit 
at HQ in Ottawa. 
 
 
 
TR/PR Enrolment Workflow  
This workflow is used to biometrically enrol eligible travellers through the collection and 
transmission of biographic information to RCMP for screening against the three (3) main 
repositories: Criminal, Immigration, and Legacy Refugee. It is also mandatory for all PR 
applicants over the age of 14 to have their fingerprints collected. The fingerprints serve two 
main purposes: the first is to query the AFIS database for registered convictions/charges 
and/or previous refugee claim, the second is to store the fingerprint set in the AFIS IMM 
database.  
 
Furthermore, when a foreign national or a permanent resident has their fingerprints captured by a 
Canadian police agency, the CBSA will automatically receive an Unsolicited Criminal Notification 
(UCN) if they were previously biometrically enrolled by the CBSA or IRCC in the TP/PR or 
Refugee workflows, including foreign nationals who provided biometrics for their Temporary 
Resident Visa, Work Permit, Study Permit, or Temporary Resident Permit applications.

UCNs are only received from police agencies for individuals for whom biometrics were previously 
collected and ensure that interactions with Canadian police agencies are provided to 
CBSA/IRCC for consideration in future visa, permit, and admissibility decisions. 
 
For additional information on UCNs, please refer to the Biometrics Toolkit. 
 
 
12.6 CardScanner 
The RCMP no longer accepts ink and roll fingerprint submissions from the CBSA. As such, ink 
and roll fingerprint submissions will be dealt with in the following manner: 
 
Criminal removal ink and roll fingerprints from Inland Enforcement Officers should be sent to the 
Fredericton Inland Enforcement Office: 
Canada Border Services Agency  
495 Prospect Street 
Fredericton, NB 
E3B 9M4 
Attention: Manager of Enforcement and Intelligence 
All CBSA offices conducting ink and roll fingerprints for all other reasons, such as refugee 
claimants and prints taken following arrests or convictions for criminal charges, will now send their 
C216 forms to a designated regional CBSA office for scanning and submission to the RCMP. 
Regional LiveScan coordinators will identify and inform your office as to where the C216 forms 
should be sent for scanning. To identify your Regional Coordinator, please contact the LiveScan 
Project Team at livescan@cbsa-asfc.gc.ca. All CBSA offices sending ink and roll fingerprints for 
scanning must include the BSF725 and ensure all necessary fields are properly completed.  
The CardScan application is used to scan fingerprint cards, palm prints, and photographs.  
Whether all of these functions are available depends upon the chosen workflow. CardScan allows 
you to scan the following cards: 
 
C-216 cards; 
 
Right palm print cards; 
 
Left palm print cards; and  
 
Photo  
 
 
12.7 Fingerprinting (ink and roll method) 
The ink and roll method should only be used when LiveScan is not available. To take a proper 
set of ink and roll fingerprints, an officer needs the following:  
 
a print take ink strip: an inked strip containing a special ink for fingerprinting (some offices use 
inkless pads); 
 
a print retainer pad: a rubberized pad to hold the ink strip flat; 
 
a print form holder: a holder that contains the fingerprint form; 
 
a pen; and  


===== PAGE 52 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
52 
 
a stand or table to hold the materials. 
Fingerprint forms  
C-216C (Civil Fingerprint Form): This form is green in colour and is designed for civil purposes 
such as civil security checks and applications for permanent residence.  
C-216 (Criminal Fingerprint Form): This form is brown in colour and is designed for criminal 
record searches or charges. 
C-216R (Refugee Fingerprint Form): This form is blue in colour and is designed specifically for 
refugee applicants. The C-216R incorporates the office RC number and the UCI number. The 
bottom right-hand corner is designed to accept the client’s photo.     
Loading the fingerprint form:  
Before inserting the fingerprint form into the holder, the form should be creased horizontally along 
three lines:  
 
the horizontal spaces designated for rolled impressions of the right hand;  
 
the spaces for the rolled impressions of the left hand; and  
 
the space for the plain impression.  
Note: Creasing fingerprint forms is only done for ink-roll procedures.  
12.8 Fingerprinting the person (ink and roll) 
To take ink roll fingerprint impressions, an officer should:  
 
beginning with the person's right hand and with the fingers closed, grasp the right thumb at 
the base with either the right or left hand (depending on which side of the person an officer is 
standing), supporting its tip with the thumb and index finger of the other hand; 
 
roll the thumb on the ink strip so that the entire bulbous portion (the fingerprint pattern area) is 
inked, from one edge of the nail to the other, and covering the area from the crease of the 
end joint to the tip of the digit as far as the rolling will permit; 
 
while still maintaining hold of it, roll the thumb firmly with a similar, continuous and even 
motion, on the designated right-thumb area of the fingerprint form, rotating the digit a full half 
turn, again from one edge of the nail to the other; this complete rolling is absolutely necessary 
to ensure that the entire pattern is reproduced for correct classification; 
 
ink each of the four fingers of the hand and reproduce them in their respective order in exactly 
the same manner, and then follow with the left hand. 
When fingerprinting the thumb or any finger, it is important that the person holds their remaining 
digits in a clenched hand formation (a fist), so that they do not in any way interfere with the inking 
and printing movement. 
Requirements for good fingerprints: 
 
Clearly defined rolled impressions (cores and deltas must be present). 
 
Clearly defined plain (slap) impressions. 
 
Clearly defined palm prints. 


===== PAGE 53 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
53 
 
Clearly defined ridges (no smears, smudging, broken lines or distortion).  
Taking good fingerprints  
To take good fingerprints, an officer should:  
 
before taking the first set of prints, ask for a demonstration from an experienced officer; 
 
practice taking a colleague's prints; 
 
not roll the subject's fingerprint on the ink pad in the same place twice; re-attach the ink pad 
cover and rub it to smooth out the ridges in the ink; 
 
not apply too much pressure to the finger when taking the print; (The darkness of the 
fingerprint on the form is a result of the amount of ink used, not the pressure. If done properly, 
the weight of the finger should be sufficient to produce a good quality print as long as the 
officer inked the finger properly.) 
 
develop a routine by printing the fingers in the order in which they appear on the form; at all 
times, start with the right thumb, continuing with the right index through to the right little finger, 
and then following with the left thumb, and left forefinger through to the left little finger. 
(Misplaced rolled impressions on the fingerprint form would result in a non-existent 
classification, which could never be successfully searched in the fingerprint bureau.) 
 
roll thumbs inwardly and fingers outwardly. While there is no set rule governing the direction 
of rotation of the digits during the inking and printing process, experience has shown that 
there is a natural tendency for thumbs to yield to an inwardly rotating motion (rolling the right 
thumb counter clockwise and the left thumb clockwise) and for the fingers to an outwardly 
rotating motion (rolling the right hand fingers clockwise and those of the left hand counter 
clockwise). 
 
always centre the core area of the rolled impressions. 
Plain impressions of hand 
To take plain impressions in the lower portion of the fingerprint form, the officer should:  
 
take the impressions with the four fingers of the hand extended; 
 
working with one hand at a time, place the fingers simultaneously on the ink strip, applying 
firm pressure equally to all to ensure even inking; 
 
place the hand on the appropriate space on the form, again exerting even pressure to ensure 
uniform simultaneous printing; 
 
allow for flattening of the inked fingers. The fingers should not be held together too tightly. 
This will ensure the reproduction of the greatest possible portion of the pattern in each finger. 
Ink and record the thumbs similarly in the appropriate spaces without rolling.  
Plain impressions serve to verify the accuracy of the sequence of the rolled impressions for the 
classifier and searcher in the Fingerprint Section of the RCMP.

12.9 Fingerprint search under the Migration Five High Value Data Sharing Protocol  
IRCC and CBSA officers may submit a request to have fingerprints searched against the 
immigration fingerprint holdings of a Migration Five (M5) partner country (Australia, New Zealand, 
the United Kingdom and the United States).  In the case of requests to Australia, New Zealand 
and the United States, officers should use GCMS to initiate queries. If a query has not been auto-
sent, an officer may manually initiate a query under the High Value Data Sharing Protocol 
(HVDSP) provided no exemptions apply.  
Requests to the United Kingdom should also be conducted according to the HVDSP. 
HVDSP: 
Requests will be reviewed by the Migration 5 Units at IRCC and CBSA  Headquarters (HQ). HQ 
will decide whether or not to make a formal request under the Protocol. 
Requests may be sent to IRCC or CBSA HQ using the Request for Fingerprints Search form IMM 
5674 when both of the following conditions apply: 
 
There are grounds to believe that a refugee claimant or a person found to be a refugee 
by the RPD may have claimed asylum in a Five Country Conference partner country; and  
 
Confirmation of that contact would have an impact on any proceeding carried out under 
the IRPA. 
Requests should not be made for persons who: 
 
Are known to be citizens of an M5 country; or 
 
Are making a refugee claim against an M5 country. 
Please note that any fingerprints sent to the UK must be sent within 30 days of enrollment. 
However, if more than 30 days but less than 90 days have passed, only ink and rolled fingerprints  
can be sent.   
 
For additional details on information sharing and the HVDSP, please consult the Biometrics 
Toolkit. 
13. Procedure: Photographing 
13.1 Authority to photograph 
Section A10.01 and subsection A16(2) provide the legal authority to photograph foreign nationals 
making a claim, application or request under the Act. This includes but is not limited to foreign 
nationals who are applying: 
 
to enter Canada; 
 
for visas or other documents at a visa office;  
 
for permanent residence in Canada;  
 
to vary or cancel conditions imposed; or 
 
for refugee protection. 


===== PAGE 55 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
55 
A16(3) provides authority to photograph any permanent resident or foreign national who is 
arrested, detained, subject to an examination or a removal order that may be used to establish 
their identity or compliance with the Act. Officers should be considerate of religious and cultural 
sensitivities when taking photographs (e.g. photographing women who wear a veil) and try to 
accommodate the person being photographed whenever possible.  
 
R12.1 lists the prescribed foreign nationals required to submit biometric information.  
 
R12.3 specifically states that the prescribed biometric information to be collected is a photograph 
of the foreign national.   
13.2 Taking photographs  
While it is recognized that photographs may not always be taken under optimal conditions, it is 
important that officers take the best quality photographs possible. Photographs are an asset when 
trying to locate an individual, issuing a warrant for arrest and for removal arrangements.   
Officers are required to scan and upload photographs to GCMS (eDocs) in addition to placing 
them on the physical file. Circumstances may occur where the file cannot be physically 
transferred to another office, therefore granting access to the photo will assist in confirming 
identity.   
When taking photographs, officers should: 
 
ensure there is uniform lighting and not show shadows, glare or flash reflections; 
 
select a plain white background with a clear difference between the face and the background; 
 
have sunglasses, tinted eye glasses, excessive jewellery, hats and head coverings (unless 
they are worn daily for religious beliefs or medical reasons) or anything that may impair the 
picture removed; 
 
 ensure that if the hair is worn down it does not cover the face or ears; 
 
ensure that if glasses are worn, the eyes are clearly visible and there is no glare in the 
glasses; 
 
ensure the photo is taken with a neutral facial expression (person’s eyes are open and clearly 
visible, mouth closed, no smiling); 
 
ensure the photo is 50 mm wide X 70 mm high (2 inches wide x 2-3/4 inches long) and sized 
so the height of the face measures between 31 mm (1-1/4 inches) and 36 mm (1-7/16 inches) 
from chin to crown of head; 
 
ensure the photo is taken straight on, with face and shoulders centred and squared to the 
camera (i.e. the photograph must show the full front view of the person’s head and shoulders, 
showing full face centred in the middle of the photograph); 
 
retake the picture making the appropriate adjustments if the quality of the photo is poor. 
Officers should take as many pictures as they deem reasonable. Extra pictures should be taken 
and attached to the person’s file to be used as necessary at a later date. An optimal photo should 
conform to the following sample: 


===== PAGE 56 =====
ENF 12: Search, Seizure, Fingerprinting and Photographing 
 
2022-11-18  
 
56 
 
Note: Not actual size, refer to measurements above. 
13.3 Photographing minors 
A16 provides authority to photograph foreign nationals making an application and this includes 
minor children. A photograph can be an important means of identifying a child. 
An officer should keep in mind that the comfort level of the child is very important. It is usually 
best to photograph a child in the presence of a parent or guardian. A very young child who is not 
comfortable being photographed alone may be photographed in the arms of a parent or legal 
guardian. 
13.4 Photographing Tattoos 
 
Subsection A16(3) does not give officers the legal authority to conduct searches and take 
photographs of tattoos. Therefore, officers must rely on section A139 if they wish to do so. This 
means that officers need to have reasonable grounds to believe that circumstances described in 
A139(1)(a) or A139(1)(b) apply in order to perform a search and be able to articulate why the 
search was done. It is only in the context of a legal search as described in A139 and if an officer 
were to incidentally come across any tattoos, that may support information relating to an IRPA 
inadmissibility, that an officer may take a photograph. Therefore, photographing tattoos at a Port 
of Entry should only be done in exceptional cases when a photograph of the tattoo combined with 
other information could provide evidence of an IRPA inadmissibility on any grounds (e.g. criminal 
inadmissibility, organized crime, security, war crimes, etc.). In such cases that an individual must 
disrobe for a tattoo to be photographed, procedures outlined in section 6.11 on Conducting 
Disrobement Searches should be followed. If no link to an inadmissibility proceeding is being 
pursued or exists, officers may note a presence of visible tattoos with a description in GCMS as a 
personal identifier in the event the person is later subject to IRPA enforcement action. Officers 
should not, however, rely on A139 IRPA search authority to collect information on tattoos merely 
for intelligence collection purposes.
