1 What this chapter is about 
 
This chapter provides functional direction and guidance on writing a report under subsection 
44(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and how to prepare and present 
such a report to the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (PS) or the Minister 
of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). 
 
 
2 Program objectives 
 
The objectives of Canadian immigration legislation with regard to the inadmissibility provisions 
are: 
 
to protect the health and safety of Canadians and to maintain the security of Canadian 
society; 
 
to promote international justice and security by fostering respect for human rights and 
denying access to Canadian territory to persons, including refugee claimants, who are 
criminals or security risks. 
 
 
3 The Act and Regulations 
 
The following table includes some of the most relevant provisions under the IRPA or the 
Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) that may apply during the A44(1) 
process. Some of the authorities listed below pertain specifically to Border Services Officers 
(BSOs) at the port of entry or IRCC officers assessing applications; others are more relevant to 
CBSA Inland Enforcement Officers (IOEs).

4 Instruments and delegations 
 
A4 sets out which Minister is responsible for the administration of the IRPA. The Minister of 
Citizenship and Immigration [also known as Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada 
(IRCC)] and the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness (PS) are jointly 
responsible for the administration and enforcement of the IRPA, however there are some 
differences. The IRCC Minister is responsible for the overall administration of the IRPA, unless 
otherwise specified. The Minister of PS has the primary responsibility for the administration of 
the IRPA as it relates to the following:  
 
 
port of entry examinations; 
 
policy lead relating to enforcement of the IRPA including arrest, detention and 
removal; 
 
establishment of policies respecting the enforcement of the IRPA and 
inadmissibility under A34/A35/A35.1/A36(2.1)/A37; and 
 
declarations referred to under A42.1 (Ministerial Relief provision) 
 
Pursuant to A6(1), the responsible Minister has the authority to designate specific persons or 
classes of persons to carry out any purpose of any provision of the IRPA with respect to their 
individual mandate as described in A4, and to specify the powers and duties of the officers so 
designated. This is referred to as the designation of authority. In addition, A6(2) authorizes 
that anything that may be done by the Minister under the Act may be done by a person that the 
Minister authorizes in writing. This is referred to as delegation of authority.   
 
Each Minister who has responsibilities under the IRPA has written an instrument of delegation 
and designation that is periodically updated. The Delegation of Authority and Designations of 
Officers (D & D) instruments stipulate who has the authority to perform specific immigration-
related functions. CBSA and IRCC personnel are designated by position to perform all 
delegated or designated authorities, including those associated with A44(1)/A44(2) functions. It 
is to be noted that the IRPA D & D instruments have a hierarchical link which means only the 
lowest level of authority is included in the D & D instruments as every position above this one 
(with a direct hierarchical link) has the same authority to perform specific immigration-related 
functions. 
 


===== PAGE 9 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20

CBSA and IRCC officers should always review both the CBSA and the IRCC D & D instruments 
as they have authorities delegated and designated under both instruments, which can be found 
on the IL 3 –  Designation of Officers and Delegation of Authority.  
 
The authority of an officer to prepare an inadmissibility report under A44(1) has been 
designated to certain CBSA and IRCC officials. It is important to note that while IRCC officers 
have been designated the authority to write reports for most inadmissibility sections, A44(1) 
reports for inadmissibility under A34 (security grounds), A35 (grounds of violating human or 
international rights), A35.1 (sanctions) and A37 (grounds of organized criminality) may only be 
prepared and reviewed by CBSA.  
 
All reports written by CBSA or IRCC officers will be reviewed by the Minister’s Delegate (MD) 
who has been delegated the authority under the D & D instruments. If the MD is of the opinion 
that the report is well-founded, the MD will make the appropriate decision based on the 
evidence and determine whether to:  
 
 
issue a removal order, if the allegation is within the MD’s authority pursuant to 
R228); or  
 
refer the report to the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board  
(IRB) pursuant to R229. 
 
For additional information see Appendix F:  Table: Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
(IRPA) Inadmissible Classes  
 
Note:  Policy requires that even where officers and officials acting in the capacity of the 
Minister’s Delegate (including chiefs and directors) have the delegated authority under 
the D & D instruments, they should not perform Minister's Delegate functions and 
reviews until they have successfully completed the necessary training to perform the 
A44(2) function.  This policy is consistent with the Federal Court’s decision in Zhang v. Canada 
(Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 362 where judicial review was granted based on a 
finding that there was an inadequate record before the court to conclude that the MD had 
received the required Minister’s Delegate Review training and was therefore authorized to issue 
a removal order.   
 
 
5 Definitions

Minor  
A minor is a person under 18 years of age. Persons claiming to be less than 18 years of age.

older.  
 
Permanent resident

status under A46 [A2(1)]. 
 
Persons unable to appreciate the nature of proceedings  
This phrase refers to persons who are unable to understand the reason for the proceedings or 
why they are important, or cannot give meaningful instructions to counsel about their case. An 
opinion regarding competency may be based on the person's own admission, the person's 
observable behaviour at the proceeding, or an expert opinion on the person's mental health or 
intellectual or physical faculties. Pursuant to R228(4)(b) and R229(4)(b), the authority to issue 
any removal order for persons unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings shall be the 
ID.  
 
Protected person 
A person on whom refugee protection is conferred in Canada and whose claim or application 
has not subsequently been deemed to be rejected because of cessation or vacation 
proceedings [A95(2)] 
 
 
6 Departmental policy 
 
6.1 Procedural fairness 
 
All officers involved in the administration and enforcement of the IRPA must consider and weigh 
all the relevant facts and factors before them. All officers are to support the objectives of the 
IRPA by ensuring all decisions taken under the IRPA are consistent with the Canadian Charter 
of Rights and Freedoms (Charter)1 and the principles of natural justice and procedural fairness. 
 
The principles of natural justice exist as a safeguard for individuals in their interactions with the 
state. These principles stipulate that whenever a person's "rights, privileges or interests" are at 
stake, there is a duty to act in a procedurally fair manner. 
 
This includes, but is not limited to, the individual's rights to the following: 
 
 
know the case to be met; 
 
have an opportunity to present evidence relevant to the case; 
 
provide a response to facts or new information that will be considered by the decision-
maker; 
 
receive notice of decision and reasons for the decision; 
 
have the evidence fully and fairly considered; 
 
right to impartial decision-maker who is free from bias; and 
 
right to an interpreter where necessary and, where the person is detained, right to 
counsel.

In general terms, procedural fairness considerations to be applied in each case will be different, 
depending on a number of factors. The Federal Court has found that the content of the duty of 
fairness in A44 proceedings will vary depending on the nature and circumstances of the 
decision being made. For example, in Awed v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2006 FC 
469, the Court found that where an officer calls a permanent resident or foreign national for an 
interview in order to confirm facts that would support an A44(1) opinion and report, the content 
of the duty of fairness at the initial stage is minimal. The Court found, however, that such a 
degree of fairness requires that the officer advise the person of the purpose of the interview so 
that the person is put on notice of the possible consequences and has an opportunity to make 
meaningful submissions. In Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. 
Cha, 2006 FCA 126, the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) found that it was open to the Federal 
Court judge to find that the officer had breached the duty of fairness in failing to inform the 
applicant of the possible consequences of the initial A44(1) interview, however the FCA 
disagreed with the Federal Court’s conclusion that section A44 determinations call for a 
relatively high degree of participatory rights in respect of persons who are inadmissible on 
grounds of serious or simple criminality in Canada, as officers and MDs are simply on a fact-
finding mission at the A44 stage.  
 
It is important for officers to differentiate those cases where the MD may issue a removal order 
and those cases where the jurisdiction to issue a removal order lies with the ID, as different 
procedural requirements and considerations will apply in order to ensure that procedural 
fairness and natural justice are met.  
 
The spectrum of procedural fairness will also depend on the status of the person concerned and 
additional considerations will apply for permanent residents and protected persons (See section 
8, ‘Considerations before writing an A44(1) Report- Scope of officer discretion’; section 9.2, 
‘Special considerations for protected persons’; section 10, ‘A44(1) reports concerning 
permanent residents of Canada’). 
  
6.2 Procedures for persons less than 18 years old or persons unable to 
appreciate the nature of the proceedings 
 
R228(4) provides for specific safeguards for certain vulnerable persons by requiring that where 
the person: 
 
 
is under 18 years of age and not accompanied by a parent or an adult legally 
responsible for them;  or  
 
is unable, in the opinion of the Minister, to appreciate the nature of the proceedings and 
is not accompanied by a parent or an adult legally responsible for them 
 
the matter must be referred to the ID for an admissibility hearing.  In these cases, the MD does 
not have jurisdiction to issue a removal order.   
 
Such cases will call for a higher degree of procedural fairness at the A44 stage and officers 
must take extra care to ensure that the person’s interests are represented and that the evidence 
has been fully and fairly considered. 
 
During the ID proceedings, a designated representative will be appointed pursuant to A167(2) to 
represent the person’s interests and ensure that procedural fairness requirements are met with 


===== PAGE 12 =====

respect to presenting evidence relevant to the case and providing a response to facts or new 
information that will be considered by the decision-maker. In these hearings, parties will also be 
governed by the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada Chairperson Guideline 8: 
‘Procedures With Respect to Vulnerable Persons Appearing Before the IRB’ 
 
Where a person appears to be unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings, it is 
important for officers to identify this as soon as possible during the A44(1) process. Where an 
officer, in the course of their interactions with a person, has identified that a person has a 
suspected or known mental illness and does not appreciate the nature of the proceedings, this 
should be clearly documented in notes and flagged for the MD.  
 
In such cases, officers should also ensure that other departmental and agency guidelines with 
respect to dealing with vulnerable persons are followed.  See section 6.6 ‘Dealing with 
vulnerable persons’;  ENF 20 Detention; and ENF 34 Alternatives to Detention. 
 
For additional guidance, including how to identify a vulnerable person, see IRCC Program 
delivery instructions on Processing in-Canada claims for refugee protection of minors and 
vulnerable persons. 
 
6.3 Official languages 
 
Both the Official Languages Act and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms establish 
the right of individuals who are subject to administrative proceedings in Canada to communicate 
with employees of IRCC and CBSA in the official language of their choice, either in French or 
English. Officers carrying out the administration of the IRPA must respect the right of the 
individual to proceed in French or English. In order to ensure that procedural fairness is 
maintained, officers should ensure that the Minister’s documents are provided in the language 
of the proceedings and, where necessary, obtain translations (e.g., a certificate of conviction 
from another country that is not in French or English that the Minister is relying on as evidence). 
 
6.4 Interpreters 
 
Officers must be satisfied that the person concerned is able to understand and communicate in 
either of the official languages in which the proceeding is being held. If necessary, an interpreter 
is to be provided to enable the persons to understand and communicate fully.  
 
Note:  Travellers arriving at a port of entry into Canada do not have an automatic right to an 
interpreter upon request during routine port of entry examinations, however there are situations 
where officers at the port of entry are required to suspend the proceedings until a qualified 
interpreter is available. This may include circumstances where the officer is considering denying 
entry to the traveller. For further information, see Nere v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 
2018 FC 672.  
 
CBSA officers should consult guidelines on the use of interpreters contained in ENF 4 Port of 
entry examinations (section 8.5, ‘Use of interpreters’).  
 
For further information, see IRCC Program delivery instructions (PDI) on interpreters.

6.5 Counsel  
 
Persons do not have a right to counsel at examinations or A44(1) interviews unless they are 
detained. In all detained cases, persons must be given the opportunity to obtain and instruct 
counsel at their own expense. Counsel includes a barrister, solicitor, family member, consultant 
or friend. 
 
In detained cases, officers must inform persons of their right to counsel prior to commencing the 
interview. This right applies in all cases (port of entry or inland) where a person is detained 
under an Act of Parliament and includes situations where the person is detained by the criminal 
courts while facing charges or serving a sentence and interviewed for IRPA purposes. 
 
Port of entry:  Generally, CBSA’s policy is not to permit counsel at a port of entry examinations 
unless arrest/detention has occurred. However, if an officer is dealing with an individual who 
does have counsel present, the officer should allow the counsel to remain present as long as 
counsel does not interfere with the examination process.  
 
Note:  In Dehghani v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 
1053], the Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) determined that the principles of fundamental 
justice do not include the right to counsel for routine information-gathering, such as that 
gathered at port of entry examination interviews. The SCC further held that an Immigration 
Secondary examination at a port of entry does not constitute a detention within the meaning of 
paragraph 10(b) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.2  
 
For further information regarding the right to counsel at POE examinations, see ENF 4 Port of 
entry examinations. 
 
In non-detained inland cases (CBSA/IRCC):  A non-detained person does not have the right 
to have counsel present during A44(1) interviews, however in the spirit of procedural fairness, 
the officer shall inform the person of the possibility of obtaining counsel prior to commencing the 
interview. Officers should permit counsel’s participation should the individual subject to the 
A44(1) process have a counsel. Call-in notices for interviews should advise the person that they 
may have counsel present. 
 
Where counsel is representing the person concerned at an examination or A44(1) proceeding, 
officers should ensure that counsel’s identity, the fact of counsel’s presence at the proceeding 
and statements made by counsel on behalf of the person concerned are documented in the 
officer’s notes, and that counsel’s representations have been considered in their decision. 
Officers may also need the person’s representative to complete a Use of a Representative form 
(IMM 5476).   
 
For further information, see IRCC Program delivery instructions (PDI) on Use of 
                                               
2 Although the SCC held that secondary examination does not constitute detention, this decision also 
highlighted that detention within the meaning of section 10(b) of the Charter would result where restraints 
on the person’s liberty by state authorities have gone beyond those required for the routine processing or 
screening of their application to enter Canada. Further, while the SCC’s decision affirmed that delays in 
routine examinations due to operational necessity do not mean the person is “detained”, officers should 
be cognizant that unreasonably lengthy delays in the examination could lead to the conclusion that the 
person is detained within the meaning of section 10(b) of the Charter.

Representatives. 
 
Participation by counsel involves speaking on the client's behalf, presenting evidence and 
making submissions on the issues. Allowing counsel to participate, if ready to do so, does not 
mean that the officer is required to tolerate disruptive or discourteous behaviour by counsel. 
Where such conduct is encountered, counsel may be asked to leave and/or the proceeding may 
be adjourned to another time. In such cases, the officer should ensure to document their 
reasons for taking such action. 
 
6.6 Dealing with vulnerable persons  
 
6.6.1 Considerations for vulnerable persons in the context of A44 
 
It is an overall goal of Canada’s immigration program to treat all persons with dignity and 
respect. In exercising their IRPA authorities, officials must approach all cases in a 
nonjudgmental manner, remain sensitive to the potential needs and limitations of vulnerable 
persons, and recognize that a person they are dealing with may have experienced some form of 
violence, abuse or trauma. 
 
In the context of A44, vulnerable persons may face particular challenges, including an impaired 
ability to answer questions/provide information to officials respecting a potential IRPA 
inadmissibility, due to a physical or psychological frailty or for other reasons. Such persons may 
include, but would not be limited to: 
 
 
minors (under 18 years of age), including unaccompanied minors;  
 
elderly persons; 
 
individuals with severe medical conditions or physical disabilities;  
 
persons with a suspected or known mental illness; 
 
persons who have suffered traumatic experiences that resulted in some degree of 
vulnerability, including: 
o victims3 of gender-based violence (GBV) (see section 6.6.3); 
o victims/suspected victims of trafficking in persons (VTIPs) or family violence. 
 
In the context of A44 procedures, officers should: 
 
 
Identify vulnerable persons at the earliest opportunity in order to ensure that appropriate  
accommodations are made and any relevant considerations are factored into decisions 
and actions taken. In some instances, officers will need to use their observational skills, 
discretion and sound judgement in identifying a person as vulnerable.   
 
 
Recognize that a vulnerable individual’s ability to respond to questions or provide 
information may be severely impaired, and remain sensitive to the impact of a perceived 
vulnerability during the A44 process, including during interviews. 
 
 
To the extent possible, prevent vulnerable persons from becoming traumatized or re-
traumatized during the A44 process. 
 
                                               
3 It is important to recognize wherever the term “victim” is used, that some persons who have experienced 
violence, trauma or abuse may prefer to be referred to as “survivors” rather than “victims”. 


===== PAGE 15 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20

Where an individual who is subject to IRPA enforcement action is identified as a victim of 
violence, trauma or abuse, including victims of GBV, family violence or trafficking in persons, or 
other forms of abuse such as sexual abuse or labour abuse, officers must take a victim-
centered and trauma-informed approach in order to avoid re-victimizing people who report 
violence or abuse.  
 
A victim-centred approach focuses on the needs and concerns of victims to ensure a 
compassionate and sensitive delivery of services in a nonjudgmental manner.  
 
A trauma-informed approach is one that avoids triggering trauma that may have placed the 
individual in their current situation. 
 
The guidelines in sections 6.6.2 to 6.6.5 are aimed at assisting officers in identifying vulnerable 
persons and applying a victim-centred and trauma-informed approach when dealing with 
vulnerable persons at A44. 
 
In addition to the guidelines set out in this manual chapter, officers should always ensure that 
other Departmental and Agency guidelines with respect to dealing with vulnerable persons and 
minors are followed, including IRCC’s Program delivery instructions on Identifying sensitive 
cases and on Processing in-Canada claims for refugee protection of minors and vulnerable 
persons, where applicable. 
 
6.6.2 Sexual orientation and gender identity and expression and sex characteristics4 
 
Some IRPA enforcement cases may involve individuals with, or who are perceived to have, 
sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions (SOGIE)5 that may not conform  to 
socially accepted norms in a particular cultural environment. Such individuals include, but are 
not limited to: Two-Spirit, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and additional 
sexually and gender diverse (2SLGBTQI+) individuals. Depending on factors such as race, 
ethnicity, religion, faith or belief system, age, disability, health status, social class and education, 
individuals with diverse sexual orientations and identities may recognize and express their 
identity differently.  
 
Individuals may conceal their SOGIE out of mistrust or fear of repercussion by state and non-
state actors, or due to previous experiences of discrimination, stigmatization, bullying, 
ostracism, violence or sexual assault. These circumstances may manifest themselves as an 
individual being reluctant to discuss, or having difficulty discussing, their SOGIE with an officer 
based on a fear or general mistrust of authority figures, particularly where intolerance or 
punishment of individuals with diverse SOGIE are sanctioned by state officials in an individual’s 
country of origin. 
 
Officers need to be sensitive to the possibility that SOGIE issues may exist in any case they 
encounter when executing their IRPA authorities. Officers must follow all relevant guidelines and 
procedures pertaining to handling SOGIE cases during the A44 process, remain sensitive to 
                                               
4 Please note that terminology in this section may have further evolved following the publication date of 
this manual. Consult most recent GoC publications for most up to date terminology.   
5 Also includes individuals with, or who are perceived to have diverse sex characteristics and may also be 
referred to as SOGIESC. For example, see the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada’s 
Chairperson’s Guidelines on Proceedings Before the IRB Involving Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity 
and Expression, and Sex Characteristics: https://irb.gc.ca/en/legal-policy/policies/Pages/GuideDir09.aspx

gender-related considerations when interacting with the person and be careful to use gender-
neutral or inclusive terms or terms that reflect the person’s gender identification in 
documentation/notes and when completing Departmental and Agency forms. 
 
Officers should consult the Internationally recognized sexual orientation or gender identity or 
expression (SOGIE) definitions on IRCC’s Connexion for further information. 
 
6.6.3 Victims of gender-based violence (GBV) 
 
When considering enforcement under A44, officers need to be sensitive to the fact that a person 
they encounter may have been subjected to specific violence, trauma or abuse based solely on 
their gender, perceived gender, gender identity or gender expression, as well as sexual 
orientation. This is referred to as gender-based violence (GBV), which is a human rights 
violation.  
 
It is important to note that GBV is not limited to physical violence and can also include 
emotional/psychological abuse, harassment, threats, sexual violence, coercive control, 
humiliation, financial abuse, discrimination or neglect. It is important to note that these may also 
occur online through “cyberviolence”6.  
 
Officers should be aware that certain individuals face a greater risk of experiencing GBV, 
including:  women, girls, 2SLGBTQI+ people and people living with disabilities. Moreover, the 
risk of GBV may be increased with the intersection of any two or more of these characteristics. 
Other groups that may experience high levels of GBV may also include Black women and 
newcomer women to Canada7.  
 
Intimate partner violence (IPV), also referred to as domestic violence or spousal violence, is a 
widespread form of GBV that encompasses multiple forms of harm perpetrated by a current or 
former intimate partner or spouse. IPV can occur in many types of relationships, including 
between married or common-law spouses as well as within dating relationships, regardless of 
gender and sexual orientation and whether or not the partners co-habit. 
 
For further information respecting IPV, see the Government of Canada’s Fact sheet on Intimate 
partner violence. 
 
Depending on their cultural background, victims of GBV may be reluctant to disclose their 
experiences in order to not “shame” their families or communities. Similarly, women who have 
been subjected to IPV/domestic violence or abuse may also be reluctant to provide information, 
especially against the alleged perpetrator. Officers should be alert to such cases and will ensure 
to the extent possible that specific accommodations are made during interviews as set out  
(e.g., have a female officer either conduct or be present during an interview, and arrange, if 
possible, for a female interpreter). See section 6.6.4 below for additional guidance on 
conducting interviews. 
 
Victims and survivors of GBV may be encountered both at the port of entry or inland. In such 
cases, officers should: 
                                               
6 “Use of technologies to facilitate virtual or in-person harm including observing and listening to a person, 
tracking their location, to scare, intimidate or humiliate a person” (Government of Canada, Fact sheet: 
Intimate partner violence (Canada.ca).

 
Consider the factors that led to the individual’s breach of IRPA requirements or conditions, 
including the possibility that the person was placed in their situation as part of abuse or 
through coercion or threats; 
 
Be aware that perpetrators of GBV are known to use threats of denunciation to immigration 
authorities as a tool to control and oppress victims through fear of deportation and/or 
detention. For example, Immigration Enforcement Officers (IEOs) responding to a tip about 
a foreign national overstaying their status shall consider any such factors that may lead the 
officer to believe that the foreign national was placed in that situation by an abuser; 
 
Within the confines of an officer’s limited discretion at A44(1), be sensitive to personal 
circumstances as well as the consequences of immigration enforcement;  
 
Where appropriate and within an officer’s scope of discretion, consider other options where 
there are IRPA inadmissibility concerns. At the port of entry, this may include allowing the 
person to withdraw their application to enter Canada (i.e. Allowed to leave) or issuing a 
Temporary resident permit (TRP) to overcome an inadmissibility that may have resulted 
from GBV. In the inland and port of entry context, this may include a referral to IRCC for 
TRP consideration and/or to community-based service organizations experienced in 
providing services to GBV victims and survivors in accordance with existing policy and 
regional procedures or allowing the person to make arrangements to leave Canada if they 
plan to do so. 
 
For further resources on GBV, please refer to the Government of Canada’s Gender-Based 
Violence Knowledge Centre (Canada.ca). 
 
6.6.4 Interviewing vulnerable persons  
 
Officers must be alert to situations where a person’s ability to answer questions and present 
information during A44 proceedings may be impacted by one or more factors listed in section 
6.6.1 above. Officers may find that vulnerable persons may have issues affecting their memory, 
behaviour, or ability to recount relevant events including symptoms that have an impact on the 
consistency and coherence of their statements.  
 
Officers should be cognizant that individuals react to violence, trauma and abuse in different 
ways and not all victims will exhibit identical or even similar signs and/or symptoms. While some 
individuals may show signs of distress, including anxiety, irritability, nervousness, agitation, 
anger and aggressiveness, others may be easily intimidated and have difficulty communicating. 
 
In order to conduct A44 interviews in a way that avoids traumatizing vulnerable persons or re-
victimizing persons who have experienced violence, trauma or abuse, officers should: 
 
Recognize that some vulnerable persons may display less obvious symptoms of a 
vulnerability, which may not become apparent until the person is interviewed/examined. 
Officers may need to rely on observational skills and sound judgement in identifying 
signs and symptoms of a vulnerability.   
 
Be aware that some vulnerable persons may require special accommodations during the 
interview. Remain sensitive to the fact that victims of severe trauma may have difficulties 
coping with the interview process because they are confined to a closed room with the 
interviewer. 
 
Create optimum conditions to minimize stress. Allow for frequent breaks, if necessary 
and to the extent possible.  


===== PAGE 18 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
18 
 
 
 
Be conscious of cultural and gender considerations which may affect communication 
such as the person and officer being the same gender, where possible. 
 
Recognize that victims of violence or abuse may fear people in authority and may be 
intimidated by the many questions that are being asked by officials. 
 
Recognize that victims of GBV or other forms of violence or abuse may become 
distressed at the prospect of being interviewed by an officer of the opposite sex. 
 
Where appropriate, speak to the person alone first in a confidential setting and ask if 
they are comfortable speaking in front of family members (particularly parents, children 
or relatives of a particular gender). 
 
Provide the person with a fair opportunity to tell the story. 
 
Be cognizant that there may only be one opportunity for an individual to reach out to 
authorities, and for authorities to refer a victim of violence or abuse to victim support 
services.  
 
Be courteous, respectful, sensitive and aware of own biases. 
 
Be aware that some questions may cause a victim to recall painful events. 
 
Treat the person with sensitivity and with empathy and with full respect of their human 
rights. 
 
Avoid an authoritarian approach. 
 
Avoid over-familiarity through eye contact or body language. 
 
Ask simple questions and use encouragement. 
 
Use active listening. 
 
Allow free speech and avoid interruption. 
 
Remember that if the vulnerable person is under 18 years of age or unable to appreciate 
the nature of the proceedings, procedural safeguards set out in section 6.2 will apply. 
 
6.6.5 TRPs for victims or suspected victims of trafficking in persons (VTIP) or family 
violence  
 
Officers should keep in mind that there are specific policy guidelines in place respecting 
suspected or known victims of trafficking in persons (VTIP) and victims of family violence. While 
only IRCC officials may issue TRPs to VTIPs or victims of family violence, CBSA officials should 
follow the guidelines set out in the IRCC Program delivery instructions for handling these cases. 
For example, cases in which a foreign national is identified by the CBSA as a VTIP or victim of 
family violence should be referred to the responsible IRCC local office on an urgent basis. There 
are also instructions pertaining to IRCC procedures for contacting CBSA with respect to 
individuals who are subject to a removal order that are applying for a VTIP or victim of family 
violence TRP.  
 
When dealing with victims or suspected victims, officers must continue to apply existing policy 
guidance respecting VTIPs and victims of family violence. For example, officers will take a 
victim-centred and trauma-informed approach when a permanent resident or foreign national is 
identified as a possible VTIP and follow existing guidelines and procedures specific to 
identifying and interviewing suspected VTIPs, as well as identifying and conducting interviews 
for suspected human traffickers who are encountered at the port of entry or inland.  
 
Officers should always be alert to any information that raises concerns that a minor child has 
been trafficked, smuggled or abducted. In such situations, officers should refer to the 
procedures set out in the following guidance: 
 
ENF 21 Recovering missing, abducted and exploited children  


persons

7 Procedure: Making a decision to write an A44(1) report 
 
7.1 Preparation and transmission of an A44(1) report 
 
Under A44(1), an officer may prepare a report if that officer is of the opinion that a permanent 
resident or foreign national in Canada is inadmissible. Officers cannot assign the discretionary 
authority to another person, nor can another person fetter an officer’s discretion by obliging an 
officer to do or not do something that is at the officer’s discretion. However, once a report is 
prepared under A44(1), it must be transmitted to the MD. 
 
Although an A44(1) report may result from an examination, an examination is not a necessary 
prerequisite for an officer to prepare and transmit a report to the MD. This is due to the fact that 
officers are only authorized to proceed with an examination under prescribed circumstances.   
For further information regarding the examination process, please refer to section 11.4, 
‘Procedure: Overview of the examination process’ and ENF 4 Port of Entry Examinations. 
 
The wording of A44(1) allows an officer to prepare a report in relation to a permanent resident or 
a foreign national “who is in Canada”. In most cases, particularly in regards to foreign nationals, 
the inadmissibility will be directly linked to the person’s physical presence in Canada (e.g., non-
compliance with A29(2) for remaining in Canada beyond the period authorized). In general, an 
officer will only prepare an A44(1) report where the person is physically present in Canada, 
however this requirement must be considered in context. Where an officer receives credible 
evidence that a foreign national or permanent resident is no longer in Canada, the officer should 
not proceed to write a report under A44(1). However, given that permanent residents have a 
right of entry and may be out of Canada for a number of reasons (e.g., vacation, work, etc.), it 
may be reasonable for an officer to proceed to write an A44(1) report against a permanent 
resident without confirming that the permanent resident is physically present in Canada at the 
time of the writing of A44(1) report, as long as procedural fairness requirements have been met. 
This will also depend on the facts and circumstances of the case and may only be considered 
where there is no credible information to suggest that the person is no longer residing in 
Canada.  
 
7.2 Procedure: Evidentiary requirements 
 
To form the opinion that a person is inadmissible to Canada, an officer must have knowledge of 
the evidentiary rules and requirements for immigration matters. Knowledge of what may be 
required to substantiate an allegation of inadmissibility is an important consideration in all cases. 
Each allegation has specific requirements for evidence and officers are to be guided by the 
content of ENF 1 Inadmissibility; ENF 2 Evaluating Inadmissibility; and ENF 18 Human or 
international rights violations. 
 
Before officers make a decision to write a report under A44(1), they must be satisfied that the 
applicable burden and standard of proof can be met and that sufficient evidence has been or 
may be gathered to ensure that each element of an inadmissibility allegation can be satisfied. 
 
 
7.3 Burden of proof 
 
The burden of proof, in the context of immigration legislation, refers to who is responsible for 
establishing admissibility under the IRPA. 
 


===== PAGE 20 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
20 
 
 
Under A45(d), the burden of establishing admissibility depends on whether or not the person 
has been authorized to enter Canada.  
 
In cases of foreign nationals who are seeking entry (primarily applicable to Port of Entry cases) 
or those who entered Canada illegally, the onus is on the individual to establish that they are not 
inadmissible. Where the person has been authorized to enter Canada, the burden to establish 
inadmissibility is on the Minister.

national becomes a permanent resident 
and A22(1) states that a foreign national 
becomes a temporary resident if an officer 
is satisfied that, inter alia, the foreign 
national is not inadmissible. 
This applies to persons seeking entry into 
Canada or those persons who have 
entered illegally. Consequently, the onus is 
on these persons to establish that they are 
not inadmissible.

7.4 Standard of Proof 
 
The term “standard of proof” refers to the degree to which the decision-maker must be satisfied. 
 
Immigration proceedings are civil in nature and therefore the general standard of proof is the 
one applicable to civil matters: balance of probabilities. However A33 provides that, unless 
otherwise provided, the standard of proof for allegations listed under sections A34 to A37, is a 
lower standard of proof: reasonable grounds to believe that the facts have occurred, are

occurring or may occur, applies. 
 
“Balance of Probabilities” is a civil standard of proof used in administrative tribunals. It means 
that the evidence presented must show that the facts as alleged are more probable than not. 
The party having the burden of proof must demonstrate that the evidence presented outweighs 
any opposing evidence or arguments. It is a higher standard of proof than “reasonable grounds 
to believe”, but is lower than the criminal standard of “beyond a reasonable doubt” used in 
criminal proceedings. 
 
“Reasonable grounds to believe” is a bona fide belief in a serious possibility that a fact has 
been established based on credible evidence. Reasonable grounds to believe is more than 
suspicion. Some objective basis for the belief has to exist. Put another way, the fact itself need 
not be proven; it is enough to show reasonable grounds for believing the allegation true. 
Information used to establish reasonable grounds should be specific, compelling, credible and 
be received from a reliable source. 
 
The following table summarizes the standard of proof for sections A34 to A42:

8 Considerations before writing an A44(1) Report- Scope of officer     
       discretion      
             
8.1 Limited discretion of officer at A44(1) 
 
The fact that an officer has the discretionary power to decide whether or not to write an A44(1) 
report does not mean that the officer can disregard the fact that someone is, or may be, 
inadmissible. 
 
Rather, discretion under A44 means that officers and MDs have some flexibility in managing 
cases where the person is inadmissible, however the objectives of the IRPA may or will be 


===== PAGE 22 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
22 
 
 
achieved without the need to seek a removal order or write a formal inadmissibility report under 
A44(1), for example:  
 
•  where an officer allows the voluntary withdrawal of an application to enter Canada 
(Allowed to leave) option at a port of entry (see section 9.4); 
•  where an officer decides to issue a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) to a foreign 
national who is seeking entry to work in Canada and who was convicted of a non-violent 
offence many years ago, taking into account the relevant assessment risk factors (see 
section 9.7); 
•  where a person is already the subject of a removal order and an officer has 
determined that the objectives of the IRPA would not be served by the issuance of an 
additional removal order; 
•  where an IRCC officer restores status to a foreign national who has remained in 
Canada beyond the period authorized. 
 
While the body of case law respecting the scope of an officer’s discretion varies, the courts have 
affirmed that an officer’s discretion under A44, is very limited.  
 
The courts have also found that this scope of discretion varies depending on the inadmissibility 
grounds alleged, whether the person concerned is a permanent resident or a foreign national, 
and whether the MD or the Immigration Division has the authority to issue a removal order. In 
other words, the scope of discretion has been viewed as “variable and flexible”.8 
 
For example, in Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v. Cha, 2006 
FCA 126, a case involving a foreign national inadmissible under paragraph 36(2)(a) of the IRPA, 
the Federal Court of Appeal (FCA) outlined that the particular circumstances of a foreign 
national, the nature of the offence, the conviction, and the sentence are beyond the reach of an 
officer when considering whether or not to write an A44(1) report for criminality or serious 
criminality against a foreign national.  
 
More recent jurisprudence9 confirms that officers making decisions under A44 have very limited 
discretion, particularly in matters concerning serious criminality and organized criminality, and 
that there is no obligation to consider factors related to humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) 
or ‘personal circumstances’. These decisions also confirm that at this the 44 stage, officers and 
MDs are conducting a fact-finding mission into “readily and objectively ascertainable facts” and 
that this administrative screening function applies to both foreign nationals and permanent 
residents. 
 
In all cases, officers must carefully consider the consequences of not writing an A44(1) report as 
a means of creating a formal record of an inadmissibility, given that this decision may have an 
impact on possible future dealings with the person. This will be particularly important in cases 
involving security (A34), violation of human or international rights(A35), sanctions (A35.1), 
serious criminality [A36(1)] and organized criminality (A37), regardless of the status of the 
individual. In such cases, it is important to have a formal record of that inadmissibility. This is 
best accomplished by preparing an A44(1) report.

Note:  In most cases where an officer has made a decision to manage a case of an 
inadmissible person without writing an A44(1) report (e.g., where an officer is exercising their 
discretion to issue a TRP to overcome inadmissibility or allow the withdrawal of an application to 
enter Canada), there will be a corresponding disposition in GCMS which contains the officer’s 
reasons and rationale. However, where an officer’s decision does not have a corresponding 
record in GCMS, officers should record their decision, rationale and any specific circumstances 
considered in their decision in GCMS notes. 
 
8.2 Priority Cases: Inadmissibility under A34, A35, A35.1, A36(1) and A37 of the 
IRPA 
  
It was affirmed by the FCA in Sharma v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 
2016 FCA 319, that within the context of A44, officers and the MD must always be mindful of 
Parliament’s intention in drafting the IRPA to make security of Canadians a top priority. 
 
In Sharma, the FCA also concluded that the Court’s rationale in Cha in support of a limited 
discretion under A44 would appear to apply equally to both foreign nationals and permanent 
residents. 
 
Although the factors contained in these guidelines may be considered when writing an A44(1) 
report, an officer must always consider the various objectives of the IRPA, in particular A3(1)(h) 
and (i). As suggested by Federal Court of Canada jurisprudence, in cases of inadmissibility 
under A34, A35, A36(1) and A37, the scope of discretion enjoyed by officers making a decision 
regarding whether or not to write an A44(1) report will be very narrow and it generally is 
reasonably open to an officer or an MD to prioritize public safety and security. 
 
 
9 A44(1) reports concerning foreign nationals  
 
9.1 Considerations before writing an A44(1) report 
 
Keeping in mind the scope of discretion related to considerations for writing an A44(1) report 
outlined in section 8 of these guidelines, the following non-exhaustive factors may be 
considered when exercising the limited discretion under A44(1) with respect to foreign nationals 
(including officer options at the port of entry such as allowing the person to withdraw their 
application to enter Canada under R42): 
 
 
Has the person been granted protected person status in Canada? What is the nature or 
category of the inadmissibility? 
 
Is the person already the subject of a removal order? 
 
Is the person already the subject of a separate inadmissibility report incorporating 
allegations that will likely result in a removal order? 
 
Is the officer satisfied that the person is, or soon will be, leaving Canada on their own 
volition? And in such a case, is the imposition of a future requirement to obtain an 
authorization to return warranted? 
 
Is there a record of the person having previously contravened immigration legislation? 
 
In the case of non-compliance, was it unintentional or excusable for a valid reason? 
 
Has the person now been fully counselled on the topic of their inadmissibility? And is the 
officer satisfied that the person now understands what is required in future to overcome 
their inadmissibility? 


===== PAGE 24 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
24 
 
 
 
Is there any reason to believe that, after having previously been counselled on the topic 
of their inadmissibility, the person simply chose to ignore that counselling? 
 
Has the person been cooperative? 
 
Is there any evidence of misrepresentation? 
 
Has the person applied for restoration of status, and does the person appear to be 
eligible? 
 
Has a temporary resident permit been authorized? 
 
How long has the person been in Canada?   
 
In minor criminality cases, is a decision on rehabilitation imminent and likely to be 
favourable? 
 
9.2 Special considerations for protected persons 
 
Under the IRPA, protected persons are provided with certain protections, including the right of 
non-refoulement under A115(1) and, subject to A64, the right under A63(3) to appeal to the 
Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) against a decision to make a removal order against them. 
This was recognized by Justice Décary in Cha, who noted that the Act and the Regulations treat 
permanent residents differently than Convention Refugees who are, in turn, treated differently 
than other foreign nationals.    
  
It should be noted, however that the Federal Court jurisprudence would support that protected 
persons are not entitled to a higher degree of procedural fairness or participatory rights with 
respect to the operation of A44(1) than other foreign nationals or permanent residents [see 
Awed v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2006 FC 469]. Officers should also keep in mind 
that the Federal Court has made findings to support the principle that officials carrying out 
A44(1) and (2) assessments are not obliged to speculate about how and when future 
deportation might take place [Faci v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 
2011 FC 693]. 
 
In cases of protected persons, officers may also consider as an additional factor in their 
recommendation to the MD, whether the facts of the case would support a referral for a 
Ministerial opinion (‘Danger Opinion’) under A115(2). For further information, see section 14.5, 
‘Overview:  Minister's opinions/interventions’. 
 
9.3 Dual intent  
 
A22(2) states that the intention of a foreign national to become a permanent resident does not 
preclude them from becoming a temporary resident if the officer is satisfied that the person will 
leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.  
 
Dual intent is present when a foreign national who has applied for permanent residence in 
Canada (or is entitled to apply for permanent residence within Canada) also seeks to enter 
Canada for a temporary period as a visitor, worker or student. If an officer has concerns/doubts 
about the foreign national's bona fides, the foreign national must be made aware of these 
concerns and given an opportunity to respond to them.  
 
Some examples of dual intent could include: 
 
 
a foreign national frequently visiting a Canadian spouse who has complied with 
previous conditions of entry and is otherwise not inadmissible, even if an application 


===== PAGE 25 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
25 
 
 
for permanent residence has not yet been submitted; 
 
a foreign national who has applied or intends to apply for permanent residence, but 
is visiting Canada to assess employment opportunities, setting up household, etc. 
 
The Federal Court in Rebmann v. Canada (Solicitor General), 2005 FC 301 held that an officer 
is required to take into account the foreign national's dual intent in entering/remaining in Canada 
as a temporary resident and provide analysis of the relevant evidence with regards to the 
foreign national’s intention to establish permanent residence in Canada to show that the foreign 
national will not leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay as a temporary 
resident. 
 
An officer should distinguish between a foreign national whose intentions are bona fide and a 
foreign national who has no intention of leaving Canada at the end of their authorized stay if the 
application for permanent residence is refused.  
 
However, the possibility that a foreign national may, at some point in the future, be approved for 
permanent residence does not absolve the individual from meeting the requirements of a 
temporary resident, specifically, to leave Canada at the end of the period authorized for their 
stay, in accordance with R179. 
 
In assessing the foreign national’s intentions, officers should weigh all the factors relevant to the 
case, including the length of time the foreign national has spent in Canada, the means of 
support; obligations and ties in the home country, previous compliance with requirements of the 
IRPA and any compassionate circumstances of the person concerned. These factors should be 
considered before proceeding with administrative enforcement action [i.e., writing an A44(1) 
report].   
 
Officers are reminded to use their own judgment and the flexibility afforded to them by 
subsection A22(2) when making decisions on cases where the foreign national also has the 
intention to become a permanent resident.  
 
In all cases, officers must ensure that GCMS notes clearly demonstrate the officer’s reasoning 
in their decision. 
 
For further guidance on assessing dual intent considerations, see IRCC Program delivery 
instructions on Dual intent. See also: ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. 
 
9.4 Allowing withdrawal of application to enter Canada/ Allowed to leave (Port of 
entry cases)   
 
If a Border Services Officer examines a foreign national seeking entry and the person is alleged 
to be inadmissible, the officer may allow the person to voluntarily withdraw their application to 
enter the country and leave Canada. 
 
Under R42, the officer who examines a foreign national who is seeking to enter Canada and 
who has indicated that they want to withdraw their application to enter Canada shall allow the 
foreign national to withdraw their application, unless R42(2) applies. 
 
R42(2) provides that a foreign national shall not be allowed to withdraw their application to enter 
Canada where a report under A44(1) is being prepared or has been prepared, unless the 


===== PAGE 26 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
26 
 
 
Minister does not make a removal order or refer the report to the ID for an admissibility hearing.  
In other words, once an officer writes an A44(1) report, the allowed to leave option may 
only be exercised at the MD level. 
 
Before writing an inadmissibility report under A44(1), officers should determine whether the 
objectives of the IRPA are better served by allowing the person to voluntarily withdraw their 
application to enter Canada pursuant to R42. In such circumstances, the same factors as 
outlined above in section 9.1, ‘Considerations before writing an A44(1) report’, are applicable. 
 
If a person is allowed to leave Canada voluntarily, officers should counsel the person as follows: 
 
 
inform the person why they are believed to be inadmissible; 
 
inform the person that if they leave Canada voluntarily, they will be free to seek entry to 
Canada once the factor causing inadmissibility has been overcome; and 
 
inform the person of the possible consequences of an A44(1) report, including the 
possibility of an admissibility hearing and/or a removal order being made against them. 
 
If a person is allowed to leave Canada voluntarily, the officer or MD must give the person  an 
Allowed to Leave Canada form (IMM 1282B).  
 
For further information on this procedure, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations.  
 
9.5 Procedure:  Directing persons back to the United States under R41 
 
R41 authorizes an officer to direct a foreign national seeking to enter Canada from the United 
States (U.S.). to return to the U.S. if: 
 
no officer is able to complete an examination (R41(a)); 
 
the Minister is not available to consider, under A44(2), a report made with 
respect to the person (R41(b));  
 
an admissibility hearing cannot be held by the ID (R41(c); or 
 
the foreign national is prohibited from entering Canada by an order or regulation 
under the Emergencies Act or the Quarantine Act 
 
In such cases, the person concerned may be given a Direction to Return to the United States 
form (BSF505) in appropriate circumstances.   
 
Officers should be aware that refugee claimants may only be directed back to the U.S. under 
exceptional circumstances. For further guidance on how and when to use the direct back 
policy for refugee claimants at land POE under exceptional circumstances, officers must consult 
ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. 
 
A person who has been directed to return to the U.S. pending an admissibility hearing by the ID 
and who seeks to come into Canada for reasons other than to appear at that hearing is 
considered to be seeking entry. If such a person remains inadmissible for the same reason(s), 
and if a member of the ID is not reasonably available, the person may be directed again to 
return to the U.S. to wait until a member of the ID is available. In these circumstances it is not 
necessary to write a new A44(1) report. 
 
Note: Persons directed back to the U.S. who choose not to return to Canada will not be subject 
to enforcement action, as they have no desire to continue with their application to enter Canada. 


===== PAGE 27 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
27 
 
 
Such persons will simply be deemed to have withdrawn their application. Officers should 
therefore not counsel the person that failure to return in these instances will result in 
enforcement action while the person is not in Canada. 
 
In exceptional cases, it may be appropriate to pursue enforcement action for persons seeking 
entry who have failed to comply with R44(3) following a Direction under R41. Officers should 
consider all information and individual circumstances of each case before they elect to proceed 
with writing an A44(1) report for non-compliance, including the circumstances surrounding the 
failure to comply and the intent of the person concerned. 
 
For further information, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. 
 
9.6 Restoration of status 
 
R182 describes a mechanism by which a visitor, worker or student who has lost temporary 
resident status for having failed to comply with any of the conditions imposed under R185(a), 
R185(b)(i) to (iii) or R185(c), may nevertheless submit an application to IRCC within the 90-day 
period of the loss of their status and, if eligible, have that status restored.  
 
It is important to note that under the D & D instruments, only IRCC officials have the authority to 
consider an application for restoration of status. 
 
The application submitted to IRCC shall be approved if the processing officer is satisfied that the 
foreign national continues to meet the initial requirements of their stay, and has not failed to 
comply with any other conditions imposed and is not the subject of a declaration made under 
A22.1. It is to be noted that an officer shall not restore the status of a student if the student is not 
in compliance with a condition set out in R220.1(1). 
 
Note:  If a temporary resident has applied for an extension of their authorized status before the 
status expires, they are considered to have maintained status (formerly referred to as “implied 
status”) until a decision is made on their application. Maintained status works by operation of 
law [R183(5)], and the temporary resident cannot be reported for non-compliance until a 
decision is made on their application for an extension, unless other IRPA inadmissibilities are 
present. For further details regarding procedures for persons with maintained status, see IRCC 
Program delivery instructions on Temporary residents: Maintained status during processing 
(previously called implied status). 
 
The following guidelines must be taken into account by Inland Enforcement Officers (IEOs) prior 
to taking enforcement action in such cases:  
 
Scenario 1:  Foreign national is out of status, but has applied for restoration of status 
within the 90-day period and is otherwise admissible– decision pending 
 
Foreign nationals who have submitted an application to have their status restored within the 90-
day period, and who are not inadmissible under any other section of the IRPA or the IRPR, 
should not be subject to an A44(1) report. In such circumstances, officers must allow for a 
decision to be rendered by IRCC before taking enforcement action, an approach which is 
consistent with the Federal Court’s findings in Sui v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and 
Emergency Preparedness), 2006 FC 1314. 
 
 


===== PAGE 28 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
28 
 
 
 
Scenario 2: Foreign national is out of status and has not applied for restoration of status 
but still within 90-day eligibility period 
 
While there is nothing in the IRPA or the Regulations that prohibits an officer from writing an 
inadmissibility report during the 90-day restoration period where no application for restoration 
has yet been made, officers should consider whether or not to pursue enforcement action in 
such cases. After taking appropriate steps to ensure that a restoration application has not been 
made, should an officer decide to write an A44(1) report and refer the report to the MD for 
review, the officer should articulate their reasoning for  pursuing enforcement action in the 
decision, if such action is pursued prior to the expiration of the 90-day eligibility period.  
In order to adhere to the principles of procedural fairness and natural justice, the officer must 
consider each case on its own merits and may consider the following: 
 
 
Does the foreign national state that they wish to remain in Canada and for what 
purpose? 
 
Has the foreign national already made arrangements to depart Canada in the immediate 
future? 
 
Is the foreign national evasive about their departure plans or the intent to remain in 
Canada? 
 
Has the foreign national otherwise been in compliance with the terms and conditions of 
their temporary resident status? 
 
If the foreign national does not apply for a restoration of status, is the officer satisfied 
that the foreign national will appear for future immigration interviews and/or depart 
Canada voluntarily? 
 
If the officer is satisfied that the foreign national will seek to remedy lapsed status within 
the 90-day period, then the officer may wish to allow the 90-day application period to 
lapse before reviewing the case again in consideration of enforcement action.  
 
Scenario 3: Foreign national is out of status beyond the 90-day restoration of status 
eligibility period, or is otherwise inadmissible under the IRPA or Regulations 
 
If an officer encounters a foreign national who has overstayed their authorized period of stay 
beyond the 90-day eligibility period for applying for restoration of status, or where the foreign 
national is otherwise inadmissible under the IRPA or Regulations, the officer may pursue 
appropriate enforcement action, which includes writing an A44(1) report and referring it to the 
MD for a review under A44(2). 
 
9.7 Temporary Resident Permits (TRPs) - Port of entry and IRCC only 
 
In some cases, a designated officer may exercise their authority under A24(1) to issue a TRP to 
allow a foreign national who is inadmissible or does not meet the requirements of the IRPA to 
enter or remain in Canada where it is justified in the circumstances. TRPs are always issued at 
the discretion of the delegated authority and may be cancelled at any time. 
 
The authority to issue a TRP is determined by the IRCC Designation and Delegation (D & D) 
Instrument and depends on the nature of the allegation.  
 
Note:  For CBSA, TRPs may only be issued by designated officials at the port of entry. 
 


===== PAGE 29 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
29 
 
 
There are instances where the person who has the delegated authority to review the A44 report 
(the MD) does not have the designated authority to issue a TRP. In such cases, the official with 
authority to review the report (i.e., the MD) may make a recommendation to the person with the 
designated authority to issue a TRP.  
 
TRPs should only be issued in accordance with the IRPA and the IRPR, and must follow the 
IRCC Program delivery instructions on Temporary resident permits. In all cases, officers and 
MDs must leave a record, which includes detailed notes entries in GCMS, of their decision or 
recommendation.  For further information, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations, section 15.5, 
‘GCMS remarks’.  
 
TRPs should only be issued after careful consideration of all assessment factors as the 
document carries privileges greater than those accorded to other visitors, students and workers 
with temporary resident status.  Before issuing a TRP, an officer must consult the departmental 
and agency guidelines on risk assessment factors and procedures for issuing TRPs. This 
applies to both initial and subsequent TRPs.  
 
Where an officer does not have the authority to issue a TRP but has reviewed the case and is 
recommending the issuance of a TRP, the officer must prepare a written a case summary that 
includes a recommendation for a final decision.  The officer will refer the case file to the 
decision-maker with the designated authority to issue a TRP for a final determination. If the 
decision is made to issue a TRP, the decision-maker will determine the period of validity of the 
TRP.  
 
For further instructions and procedures for TRPs, officers must refer to the IRCC Program 
delivery instructions on Temporary resident permits and ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. 
 
Additional considerations for TRP issuance: 
 
 
A person is not eligible for a TRP if less than 12 months have passed since their 
claim for refugee protection was last rejected [or determined to be withdrawn or 
abandoned as described under A24(4)]. 
Exception: The one-year ban on accessing a TRP under A24(4) does not bar an 
IRCC officer, on their own initiative, from considering a TRP for a victim of human 
trafficking. 
 
There are specific IRCC policy guidelines respecting certain vulnerable persons 
including suspected or known victims of human trafficking or victims of family 
violence.  Only IRCC officials may issue TRPs to victims of human trafficking or victims 
of family violence, however CBSA officials should follow the procedures set out in the 
Program delivery instructions above for handling these cases. 
 
If a student, worker or visitor with valid temporary resident status is reported 
under A44(1) but a decision is made not to hold an admissibility hearing or issue a 
removal order, that person remains a temporary resident, and a TRP is not required 
 
9.8 A44(1) reports for inadmissible family members 
 
Officers should be aware that they may need to assemble information about the family members 
of a person who is the subject of an A44(1) report and decide whether family members should

also be reported and/or made subject to a removal order. Under A42, accompanying and non-
accompanying family members may be inadmissible to Canada under prescribed 
circumstances. This provision may only apply to family members who are foreign nationals, 
other than protected persons. 
 
Officers should always consider reporting family members in order to avoid separating families 
or having other family members abandoned when one member must be removed from Canada. 
 
R1(3) provides that: 
 
1.(3) For the purposes of the Act, other than section 12 and paragraph 38(2)(d), and for the 
purposes of these Regulations, other than paragraph 7.1 (3)(a) and sections 159.1 and 159.5, 
"family member" in respect of a person means: 
 
(a) 
the spouse or common-law partner of the person; 
(b) 
a dependent child of the person or of the person’s spouse or common-law 
partner; and 
(c) 
a dependent child of a dependent child referred to in paragraph (b). 
 
Officers should note that under A42, a foreign national who is a temporary resident, applying to 
enter or remain as a temporary resident and has a family member who is inadmissible under 
A34, A35, A35.1 or A37, is inadmissible to Canada whether they are accompanying them or not. 
It is also important to note that pursuant to the exceptions set out under A42(2), foreign 
nationals seeking temporary resident status who have an accompanying or non-accompanying 
family member who is inadmissible under any of the other provisions (A36, A38, A39, A40 or 
A41) of the IRPA cannot be reported under A42.   
 
Where an officer writes an A44(1) report against a family member for inadmissibility under A42, 
the MD has jurisdiction under R228 to issue the applicable removal order. Officers should note, 
however, that for the purposes of A52(1), the making of a removal order against a foreign 
national on the basis of inadmissibility under A42 is a prescribed circumstance that does not 
oblige the foreign national to obtain the authorization of an officer in order to return to Canada. 
 
R227 sets out the prescribed circumstances under which an A44(1) report against a foreign 
national is also considered a report against the foreign national’s family members in Canada.  
 
R227(2) provides that, in the case of a report and a removal order made by the ID against a 
foreign national who has family members in Canada, the removal order issued by the ID against 
a foreign is also a removal order against the family members in Canada without the need for a 
separate inadmissibility report provided that an officer informed the family member(s): 
 
 
of the report; 
 
that they are the subject of an admissibility hearing and, consequently, have the right to 
make submissions and be represented, at their own expense, at the admissibility 
hearing; and 
 
that they are subject to a decision of the ID that they are inadmissible under A42 on 
grounds of being an inadmissible family member. 
 
While this procedural avenue may be available under the IRPR, it is generally recommended 
that where an officer decides to pursue enforcement action against inadmissible family 
members of a foreign national under A42, the officer should proceed by way of writing a 


===== PAGE 31 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
31 
 
 
separate A44(1) report for each family member after the removal order has been made against 
the foreign national.   
 
Officers should always be alert to the possibility that the family member of a foreign national 
may be inadmissible in their own right and be mindful of situations where the evidence against a 
foreign national also independently supports an A44(1) report against their family member that 
is unrelated to the A42 inadmissibility. 
 
9.9 Impact of Ministerial public policies 
 
Before writing an A44(1) report, officers should be aware of any public policies approved by the 
responsible Minister that are currently in force, as well as any operational guidance related to 
impacts of the public policy on procedures or considerations for decisions made under the 
IRPA. In general, these public policies grant temporary remedies or exemptions for certain IRPA 
requirements for certain categories of persons who meet specified criteria set out in the policy. 
They are generally in place for a specific and temporary period of time, however, some public 
policies may remain in place for an extended period. Officers should ensure that they follow any 
new guidance or instructions related to new public policies. 
 
Officers should be aware that, unless a public policy specifies that a person is excluded from 
certain requirements under the IRPA or the IRPR, all other legislative obligations and 
inadmissibility provisions continue to apply. 
 
 
10 A44(1) reports concerning permanent residents of Canada 
 
While permanent residents are given an opportunity to make submissions as part of procedural 
fairness during the A44 process, they cannot be compelled to attend an interview, answer 
questions or provide submissions. As noted in section 11.7, permanent residents are only 
subject to an obligation to answer questions when subject to examination at a port of entry, and 
only insofar as it relates to establishing that they hold permanent resident status. 
 
The submissions and evidence provided on behalf of a permanent resident should be reviewed 
on a case-by-case basis and an officer must clearly articulate which factors were considered.  
 
Officers must ensure that all relevant factors have been addressed in their written 
recommendation to the MD and may best achieve this by preparing a narrative report under 
A44(1), which is to accompany the A44(1) report when it is transmitted to the MD. Officers must 
also ensure that they forward to the MD all submissions and documents filed by the person 
concerned as well as any other evidence relied on in the officer’s recommendation.  
 
In Hernandez v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2007 FC 
725, the Federal Court held that while a narrative report is not required when referring the 
A44(1) report to the MD, where the officer has prepared such a report, all accompanying notes 
or appendices must be provided to the MD in full. The court also held that once such material is 
created and delivered to the Minister, it must be provided to the person concerned prior to the 
admissibility hearing – this is particularly so when a specific request has been made. 
 
See Appendix E:  Sample A44(1) Narrative report.

Officers should also provide reasons for giving more weight to certain documents over others 
where there is conflicting or inconsistent information before them. For example, where there are 
conflicting versions of events pertaining to a criminal offence, an explanation as to why one 
version is being relied on over the other should be provided in the officer’s recommendation.  
 
10.1 A44(1) reports for criminality cases  
 
In Medovarski v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration); Esteban v. Canada (Minister 
of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 51, the SCC stated that the objectives in the IRPA 
reflect an intent to prioritize security and that this objective is given effect by removing persons 
with criminal records from Canada. The SCC noted that in drafting the IRPA, Parliament 
demonstrated a strong desire to treat criminals less leniently than under the former Immigration 
Act. This was noted in Sharma, where the FCA affirmed that officers and MDs, when dealing 
with matters under A44(1) and A44(2), must always be mindful of the various objectives of the 
IRPA, in particular A3(1)(h) and (i). The FCA also concluded that the Court’s rationale in Cha in 
support of a limited discretion under A44 would appear to apply equally to both foreign nationals 
and permanent residents.  
 
It is strongly urged that, whenever possible, officers who prepare the A44(1) report in serious 
criminality cases obtain detailed documentation to support the assessment. Hearings Officers 
will also find this documentation essential when presenting the case before the ID or when 
defending a removal order that is challenged at the IAD. 
 
Three principal factors indicate the seriousness of an offence:  
 
 
the circumstances of the particular incident under consideration;  
 
the sentence imposed; and  
 
the maximum sentence that could have been imposed.  
 
The fact that a conviction falls within A36(1) is itself an indication of its seriousness for 
immigration purposes. It is also important for officers to be aware that sentences imposed by the 
courts may have been subject to plea bargaining. The Crown may agree to a reduced sentence 
if the person pleads guilty. The circumstances of the crime are not viewed less seriously, but 
saving the court the time and expense of a full trial is taken into consideration in determining the 
sentence.  
 
The best documentation is a transcript of the trial judge's remarks on conviction or sentencing, 
commonly known as the Judge's Reasons for Sentence. Additionally, reports from probation 
officials, police agencies, correctional facilities, etc. provide valuable information regarding the 
circumstances of the offence and sometimes the potential for rehabilitation.  
 
The following may be considered when assessing the seriousness of an offence: 
 
I. 
Circumstances of the offence: 
 
• 
Did the crime involve violence?  
• 
Did the crime include the use of a firearm?  
• 
Was it a crime against a person (specifically, was it a crime against a child or children, 
mentally or physically challenged persons, or senior citizens), a racially motivated crime, a 
crime of gender-based violence, a hate crime or a crime involving trafficking in large 


===== PAGE 33 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
33 
 
 
quantities of drugs or in hard drugs (for example, heroin)?  
• 
How serious were the consequences for the victim? 
  
II. 
Criminal history:  
 
• 
Is the permanent resident a first time offender? 
• 
Is there a pattern of committing offences (recidivist), and, if so, are the offences committed 
becoming more serious?  
• 
Was the permanent resident influenced by others in the commission of the crime? 
 
III. 
Length of sentence:  
 
• 
What type of sentence was imposed on the permanent resident?  
• 
Was jail imposed?  
• 
Has probation or parole been denied?  
 
10.2 Loss of appeal right cases 
 
During the assessment under A44(1) for permanent residents and protected persons, officers 
should gather all information pertaining to whether or not the person will have a right of appeal 
to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD). 
 
For inadmissibility under A36(1)(a) for permanent residents, it is important for officers to obtain 
the most accurate evidence of the sentence imposed to determine whether the person retains a 
right of appeal. Under A64, a loss of appeal rights for serious criminality under A36(1)(a) must 
be with respect to a crime that was punished in Canada by a term of imprisonment of at least six 
months.  Where it is not clear from the evidence whether the sentence meets the six month 
threshold under A64(2), before making any assessment under A44(1), the officer should 
determine how the judge calculated the total sentence imposed as reflected in the court 
documents, taking into account the imposition of further credits for time served. Regardless of 
what assessment is made by the officer, and especially in cases where the right of appeal is in 
doubt, officers should clearly articulate that the determination as to whether the person 
concerned retains a right of appeal ultimately rests with the IAD. 
 
10.3 Whether to consider personal circumstances for permanent residents and protected 
persons in recommendation to MD to accompany A44(1) report 
 
During the course of A44(1) proceedings, an officer may receive evidence or submissions 
relating to a permanent resident or protected person’s personal circumstances and why a 
removal order should not be sought. 
As confirmed by the courts10, officers are not obligated to consider personal circumstances 
during the A44(1) process. However, the courts have also affirmed that officers retain the 
discretion to consider these circumstances, and if they exercise their discretion to do so, it has 
to be reasonable. The discretion is tempered by their limited role at A44(1).11 The guidance in 
this section is intended to assist officers determine when and how to exercise such discretion.

Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2023 FC 1681; Matharu v. Canada (Public Safety 
and Emergency Preparedness), 2024 FC 902

Officers must always keep in mind the principles set out in sections 8.2 and 10.1 above when 
rendering decisions under A44(1), including Parliament’s intention in drafting the IRPA to make 
security of Canadians a top priority.  
 
In consideration of the various objectives of the IRPA and the limited discretion of officers at 
A44 as confirmed by the courts, the CBSA’s policy is that officers must consider the factors 
below when deciding whether or not to exercise their limited discretion to consider evidence or 
submissions filed by the person concerned regarding personal circumstances.  
Generally speaking, the following factors would weigh against consideration of personal 
circumstances in an officer’s recommendation to the MD: 
 
the inadmissibility falls under section A34, A35, A35.1 or A37;   
 
 
A36(1) serious criminality cases in the following circumstances: 
o the permanent resident or protected person was previously issued a 
warning letter by CBSA or had a previous removal order stayed or 
quashed by the IAD on humanitarian and compassionate grounds; 
o the reportable offence: involved violence that resulted in bodily or 
psychological harm to another person, the use of a firearm or is a sexual 
offence; was committed against a vulnerable person (e.g. minor child or 
intellectually or physically challenged persons, or senior citizen), was a 
racially motivated crime, a crime of gender-based violence, including 
domestic violence, a hate crime or a crime involving trafficking or 
smuggling in large quantities of a controlled substance or weapons;  
o the criminal record of the permanent resident or protected person 
demonstrates a pattern of escalating seriousness 
 
If the decision is not to consider personal circumstances, the officer at 44(1) should state this in 
their recommendation to the MD. For example, the officer may state in their decision: “I am not 
exercising my discretion to consider evidence and/or submissions filed on behalf of (name of 
person concerned) pertaining to their personal circumstances given the seriousness of the 
reportable offence”.  
 
If an officer exercises discretion to consider personal circumstances 
 
While the courts have affirmed that an officer is not required to consider personal 
circumstances, if an officer does exercise their discretion to consider such factors, they must 
ensure that the factors considered are weighed in a fair manner and render a decision that is 
“justified, intelligible and transparent”.12 Any assessment of a person’s personal circumstances 
must be reasonable in the circumstances of the case. In addition, the courts have held that in 
cases involving allegations of criminality or serious criminality, where such factors are rejected, 
an explanation should be provided, even if only very brief in nature.13    
                                               
12 Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65, [2019] 4 SCR 653 [Vavilov]  
wherein the SCC affirmed at para. 85 that a reasonable decision is “one that is based on an internally 
coherent and rational chain of analysis and that is justified in relation to the facts and law that constrain 
the decision maker”.

If an officer decides to consider the personal circumstances of the permanent resident (or 
protected person), the CBSA’s policy is that they must balance these with the objectives of the 
IRPA to protect public health and safety, and maintain the security of Canadian society by 
denying access to Canadian territory to persons who are criminals or security risks.  
 
If an officer does exercise their discretion to consider personal circumstances in their 
recommendation to the MD, considerations may include, but are not limited to the following: 
 
 
Age at time of landing—has the person been a permanent resident of Canada 
since childhood?  
 
Was the permanent resident an adult at the time of admission to Canada? 
 
Was the person granted protected person status in Canada? 
 
Length of residence—how long has the person resided in Canada after the date 
of admission?  
 
Location of family support and responsibilities—are family members in Canada 
emotionally or financially dependent on the permanent resident? Are all extended 
family members in Canada?  
 
Degree of establishment—is the permanent resident financially self-supporting? 
Are they employed? Do they have a marketable trade or skill? Has the 
permanent resident made efforts to establish themselves in Canada through 
language training or skills upgrading? Is there any evidence of community 
involvement? Has the permanent resident received social assistance 
(frequency/duration)? 
 
Criminality—has the permanent resident been convicted of any prior criminal 
offence? Based on reliable information, is the permanent resident involved in 
criminal or organized crime activities? What is the nature and frequency of the 
person’s interactions with the law? (for further details please refer to section 10.1 
‘A44(1) reports for criminality cases’).  
 
What is the potential for rehabilitation? How much time has passed since the last 
conviction? Has the permanent resident already been released? For how long? 
Has the permanent resident accepted culpability, expressed remorse, enrolled in 
or completed educational, skills upgrading or rehabilitation programs (for 
example, Alcoholics Anonymous, Narconon/narcotics rehabilitation programs, 
anger management programs, life skills)? Are family members willing and able to 
support/assist?  
 
History of non-compliance and current attitude—has the permanent resident 
been cooperative and forthcoming with information? Has a warning letter been 
previously issued? Does the permanent resident accept responsibility for their 
actions? Are they remorseful? 
 
Best interests of any children directly affected by the decision.  
 
Right of appeal—does the person have a right of appeal to the Immigration 
Appeal Division if a removal order is issued? 
 
None of these factors will necessarily outweigh other factors of the case. Moreover, in Faci v. 
Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2011 FC 693 the Federal Court made 
findings to support the principle that officials carrying out A44(1) and (2) assessments are not 
obliged to speculate about how and when future deportation might take place. 
 
Overall, any consideration of personal circumstances, which is not required but if done, must 
be reasonable, and must be weighed against the objectives of the IRPA to protect public health 


===== PAGE 36 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
36 
 
 
and safety, and maintain the security of Canadian society, denying access to Canadian territory 
to persons who are criminals or security risks. 
 
Note: By inviting a permanent resident to provide information or make submissions regarding 
their personal circumstances at A44(1), this creates an expectation that the officer will engage 
with this information in the A44(1) assessment and address it in the decision.  
 
Where the officer at A44(1) has exercised their discretion to consider personal circumstances in 
their recommendation, the MD must consider this information and explain in their decision 
whether or not they concur with the officer’s recommendation.  
 
10.4 Residency obligation cases under A28(2) - Prescribed considerations 
 
If, following an examination of a permanent resident, an officer concludes that a permanent 
resident has failed to comply with the residency obligation under A28, the officer may prepare a 
report for inadmissibility under A41(b) against a permanent resident, taking into account 
prescribed considerations set in the IRPA. A28(2)(c) specifically requires officers and the MD to 
take into account humanitarian and compassionate considerations, including the best interests 
of a child directly affected by the determination, when assessing whether such considerations 
overcome any breach of the residency obligation prior to the determination.   
 
Officers must articulate consideration of these prescribed factors in the decision to write a report 
under A44(1) and/or their recommendation to the MD.  
 
Note:  Officers should be aware that there are procedures in place for permanent residents who 
wish to renounce their permanent resident status pursuant to A46(1)(e). In certain cases, it may 
be appropriate for a designated officer (IRCC or port of entry CBSA) to process a renunciation 
application under R72.6 in place of an A44(1) report. For further guidance, officers should 
consult with the IRCC Program delivery instructions on Renouncing permanent residence. 
 
For further information, see ENF 23 Loss of permanent resident status. 
 
 
11 Procedure: Gathering evidence for the A44(1) report 
 
11.1 Evidentiary requirements 
 
Officers should be mindful that any piece of evidence gathered may be used at an admissibility 
hearing. All evidence gathered should therefore be of a quality sufficient to satisfy the MD, or 
the ID member, of the person’s inadmissibility. 
 
Officers must take steps in all cases to provide adequate documentation to substantiate the 
inadmissibility allegation(s) in a report and evidence must be on file to support all elements of 
the inadmissibility. Files should not be forwarded to the MD or to the Hearings Officer (where 
jurisdiction lies with the ID) unless all evidence substantiating the allegation is on file, except in 
rare circumstances. In such cases, officers will record in the case notes the attempts that were 
made to obtain the evidence, so that the MD or the Hearings Officer, if applicable, may follow 
up, where it is agreed that this is appropriate. This is especially important in cases where 
detention is also being pursued.

For further information on obtaining evidence and determining equivalency, see ENF 1 
Inadmissibility and ENF 2 Evaluating Inadmissibility 
 
11.2 Evidentiary requirement: Proof of status in Canada  
 
Under the IRPA, Canadian citizens and persons registered as Indians under the Indian Act have 
an unqualified right to enter and remain in Canada and are not subject to the inadmissibility 
provisions of the IRPA. Therefore, before writing an A44(1) report, an officer must have 
evidence to confirm that the person does not hold such status in Canada. In cases of permanent 
residents, officers must confirm through the appropriate queries that the person has not 
obtained Canadian citizenship and ensure that due diligence has been exercised before 
proceeding with further enforcement action.  
 
For permanent residents, the officer must also obtain documentary evidence to establish that 
the person holds such status in Canada. For further information, see ENF 1 Inadmissibility and 
ENF 2 Evaluating Inadmissibility 
 
Note:  Due to the possibility of duplicate identities in GCMS, officers should conduct full name 
queries in the GCMS Integrated Search view to ensure accurate information is obtained. 
 
11.3 Persons claiming to be Canadian citizens or registered Indians under the 
Indian Act 
 
Under the IRPA, Canadian citizens and persons registered as Indians under the Indian Act have 
an unqualified right to enter and remain in Canada and are not subject to the inadmissibility 
provisions of IRPA. Therefore, before writing an A44(1) report, an officer should have evidence 
to confirm that the person does not hold such status. 
 
In cases of permanent residents, officers must confirm through the appropriate queries that the 
person has not obtained Canadian citizenship and ensure that due diligence has been 
exercised before proceeding with further enforcement action. 
 
Should an officer detect the possibility of Canadian citizenship or registered Indian status, the 
officer shall investigate or cause an investigation of the matter to be initiated before taking any 
further steps to write a report or refer the case to an MD. 
 
In questioning persons in this regard, officers should be fully cognizant of the Citizenship Act 
and/or make contact with a citizenship officer who can provide assistance and guidance. 
Should a person claiming to be a Canadian citizen make a refugee claim to an officer, the officer 
must ascertain whether that person is indeed a Canadian citizen. If such is the case, the officer 
should advise the person that Canadian citizens may not make a refugee claim, as they already 
enjoy the protection of Canadian citizenship and the right to enter and remain in Canada.  
 
11.4 Procedure: Overview of the examination process 
 
The procedural requirements and legal obligations related to gathering information from the 
person for the purpose of writing an A44(1) report will depend on whether the person is still 
subject to examination.  
 
Pursuant to A15(1), individuals who make applications under the IRPA are subject to an 


===== PAGE 38 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
38 
 
 
examination for various reasons, including to determine whether that person has a right to enter 
Canada or may become authorized to enter or remain in Canada pursuant to A18(1).  
 
R28 provides that, for the purposes of A15(1), a person makes an application to an officer by: 
 
• 
submitting an application in writing; 
• 
seeking to enter Canada; 
• 
seeking to transit through Canada as provided in R35; or 
• 
making a claim for refugee protection. 
 
Where the person makes an application, there is a legal obligation under  A16(1) to answer 
truthfully all questions put to them by an officer for the purpose of the examination, and produce 
all documents or other evidence reasonably required. 
 
Moreover, pursuant to A16(1.1), a person who makes an application must, on request of an 
officer, appear in person for an examination.  The power to compel someone to submit to an 
examination under 16(1.1) may be used overseas, inland and at ports of entry. 
 
 For foreign nationals, the requirement to produce evidence may extend to the provision of 
photographic and fingerprint evidence [A16(2)]. 
 Pursuant to A16(2.1), a foreign national who makes an application must, on request of an 
officer, appear for an interview for the purpose of an investigation conducted by the 
Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) and must answer truthfully all questions put 
to them during the interview. Officers should note, however, that the power to compel for a 
CSIS interview under A16(2.1) can only be used for inland and port of entry applications. 
  
For further information, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations (section 5, ‘Examinations’) 
 
11.5 End of examination 
 
The IRPR provide that an examination begins “when a person makes an application to the 
officer.” Persons seeking to enter Canada are considered to have made an application pursuant 
to R28(b) as they are “seeking to enter Canada”. 
 
R37 specifies the point at which the examination of a person who seeks to enter Canada, or 
makes an application to transit through Canada, ends. In general terms, examinations will end 
when an officer makes a decision on the application before them or, in cases referred to the 
MD, when a decision has been made.  
 
At a port of entry, with the exception of refugee claimants, persons seeking to enter or transit 
through Canada remain subject to an examination until: 
 
(a) a determination is made that the person has a right to enter Canada, or is authorized 
to enter Canada as a temporary resident or permanent resident, the person is authorized 
to leave the port of entry at which the examination takes place and the person leaves the 
port of entry; 
(b) if the person is an in-transit passenger, the person departs from Canada; 
(c) the person is authorized to withdraw their application to enter Canada and an officer 
verifies their departure from Canada; or 
(d) a decision in respect of the person is made under subsection 44(2) of the Act and the 
person leaves the port of entry. 


===== PAGE 39 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
39 
 
 
 
This means that during an examination at a port of entry the person may be brought back to an 
officer for a re-examination of their admissibility and appropriate action could be taken until the 
examination is complete. Such re-examinations may result in an A44(1) report.  
 
It should be noted by officers at the port of entry that while permanent residents are subject to 
examination when seeking entry, the IRPA gives permanent residents of Canada the right to 
enter Canada at a port of entry pursuant to A19(2) once the officer is satisfied that the person 
holds permanent resident status. The obligation to answer truthfully under A16(1) for permanent 
residents is linked to A18(1) and must be related to examination for the purpose of establishing 
that the person holds permanent resident status in Canada.   
 
While an officer who is satisfied at examination that a person holds permanent resident status 
must admit that person, the officer may also form an opinion during examination that the 
permanent resident is inadmissible for other reasons under the IRPA. In such cases, the officer 
should advise the person that while it has been established that they have a right to enter 
Canada, there are reasons to believe that they could become the subject of a report under the 
IRPA which could lead to the issuance of a removal order. If the person wishes to continue 
answering questions or providing information/submissions pertaining to the allegation, they 
should be given an opportunity but are not required to do so. Even if a permanent resident 
becomes the subject of an A44(1) report, they continue to have a right to enter until a final 
determination has been made regarding their loss of status. 
 
For further information, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations (section 5.6, ‘End of examination’ 
and section 11.4, ‘Investigating permanent residents for inadmissibility’) 
 
11.6 Procedure: End of examination for refugee claimants 
  
The point at which examination ends is different where the person is a refugee claimant as the 
application exists up until the claim has been decided. 
 
R37(2) provides designated officers the authority to examine a refugee claimant until a decision 
is made in regards to the claim. 
 
End of examination — claim for refugee protection 
 
(2) The examination of a person who makes a claim for refugee protection at a port of entry or 
inside Canada other than at a port of entry ends when the later of the following occurs: 
 
(a) an officer determines that their claim is ineligible under section 101 of the Act or the Refugee 
Protection Division accepts or rejects their claim under section 107 of the Act; 
 
(b) a decision in respect of the person is made under subsection 44(2) of the Act and, in the case 
of a claim made at a port of entry, the person leaves the port of entry. 
 
This means that even after a claim is determined eligible and referred to the Refugee Protection 
Division (RPD), officers may compel a refugee claimant to appear for an examination to verify 
and/or obtain information from the refugee claimant as the circumstances warrant, even where 
the initial examination took place at the port of entry. However, the circumstances under which a 
claimant is directed to answer questions or produce evidence related to ineligibility should be 
limited to the scope of the inadmissibility section or exclusion grounds being investigated. The

purpose of the examination should be related to identity or grounds of ineligibility, such as 
serious inadmissibility [A34, A35, A35.1, A36(1) or A37] or exclusion under section E or section 
F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention.   
 
During the examination, officers (including inland officers) will be able to question the refugee 
claimant for the purposes of the examination and require the claimant to produce all relevant 
evidence and documents that the officer reasonably requires, as new information or evidence 
becomes available while the claim is in process. 
 
 Officers should be mindful that where the refugee protection hearing is underway by the 
RPD, the authority to examine under R37(2) should proceed in a manner that does not 
interfere with the refugee protection hearing.  
 Concerns relating to the merits of the claim, or a refugee claimant's general credibility 
should not be the purpose of the examination. Instead, matters relating to the merits of the 
claim or credibility shall be raised before the RPD in the context of a Ministerial intervention 
(see section 14.5,  ‘Overview: Minister's opinions/interventions’) 
 At ports of entry, if a refugee claimant is determined to be ineligible to be referred to the 
Refugee Protection Division, the claimant continues to be under examination until: (i) a 
decision in respect of the person is made under A44(2), and (ii) leaves the port of entry. For 
information concerning port of entry immigration "end of examinations", refer to ENF 4 Port 
of Entry Examinations. 
 At inland offices, if a refugee claimant is determined to be ineligible to be referred to the 
RPD, the authority to examine the claimant ends, pursuant to R37(2)(a). Should additional 
information be required from the person to gather additional evidence necessary for an 
admissibility hearing before the ID, or to enforce a removal order, it may be collected under 
the authority provided in A16(3)- where arrested, detained, or subject to examination or a 
removal order.  Otherwise, the officer may request an in-person interview where determined 
to be appropriate (See also: section 11.7, ‘Procedure: Gathering evidence for persons not 
subject to examination’). 
 It should be noted that when refugee claimants have identified a counsel of record in their 
Basis of Claim (BOC) form or elsewhere in the record of the RPD, they have a right to have 
counsel present at an interview held in respect of their refugee claim. Counsel are to be 
notified of and given an opportunity to be present for any interview conducted for the 
purpose of gathering evidence for the refugee hearing (post-eligibility).  
 
Note: this is to be distinguished from IRPA interviews for other purposes. A refugee claimant 
does not have a right to counsel at an interview relating to their eligibility to claim refugee 
status. 
 
See Appendix A:  Sample call-in letter for interview - Refugee claimant 
 
11.7 Procedure: Gathering evidence for persons not subject to examination 
 
Where the person is no longer subject to examination, there is no legal obligation under A16 to 
provide information, however officers may request that the person voluntarily attend an interview 
in order to gather evidence and information for the purpose of determining whether an A44(1) 
report will be written and referred. In such cases, including cases for permanent residents, the 
call-in notice should state the purpose of the interview and follow the procedural fairness 
guidelines noted earlier in this manual. 
 
As noted in preceding sections, permanent residents benefit from a higher degree of 


===== PAGE 41 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
41 
 
 
participatory rights during the A44(1) process.  
 
11.8 Procedure: In-person interview (all cases) 
 
Where proceeding by way of an in-person interview, officers must always ensure that the 
person concerned understands the proceedings. For that purpose, the officer must provide the 
person concerned with an interpreter if required. 
 
The person concerned must also be given the opportunity to have counsel present at the 
interview. This is not to be confused with an unqualified right to have counsel present, however 
as already set out in section 6.5, detained individuals have the right to have a counsel of their 
choosing present during the interview. Officers must inform persons of their right to counsel 
prior to commencing the interview. This right applies in all cases where a person is detained 
under an Act of Parliament and includes situations where the person is detained by the criminal 
courts while facing charges or serving a sentence. As stated in previous sections, all detained 
cases should be interviewed in person. 
 
See Appendix D:  Sample Call-in letter for interview- Person no longer subject to 
examination (includes permanent resident and protected person) 
 
Reasonable efforts should be made to ensure that the notification letter is delivered to the most 
current address of the person concerned. Where appropriate, this may include a site visit and/or 
telephone call. This will be particularly important in cases where the loss of appeal rights under 
A64 may be involved. See section 11.10, ‘Procedure:  Failure to appear at A44(1) interview’. 
 
11.9 Procedure for submissions where no in-person interview is held: Persons no 
longer subject to examination 
 
The Federal Court affirmed in Hernandez v. Canada (Minister of Public Safety and Emergency 
Preparedness), 2007 FC 725, a case involving a permanent resident of Canada, that an oral 
interview by the officer at the A44(1) stage is not always required, as long as the affected 
person is given an opportunity to make submissions and to know the case against them. This 
principle was affirmed in Sharma v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 
[2017] 3 FCR 492, 2016 FCA 319. In that case, the FCA also confirmed that the duty of fairness 
does not require that the A44(1) report is put before the person before a decision is made by the 
MD to refer that report to the ID pursuant to A44(2), provided that such a report is 
communicated to the affected person before the hearing of the Immigration Division. In other 
words, officers must ensure that the report under A44(1) is provided to the person concerned 
before the hearing of the ID. As a matter of practice, disclosure of the report will usually occur at 
the time that the admissibility hearing package is served on the permanent resident by a 
Hearings Officer or Hearings Advisor in advance of the hearing, in accordance with the ID Rules 
for disclosure. 
 
Where an officer elects not to proceed by way of an in-person interview and elects to proceed 
by way of written submissions, the officer must notify the person concerned in writing of the 
allegation and the process to be followed, and provide them with an opportunity and reasonable 
time to provide submissions and information related to their case.  
 
See Appendix B:   Sample letter to be sent where no interview is requested- Person no 
longer subject to examination (includes permanent resident and protected person) 


===== PAGE 42 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
42 
 
 
 
Where proceeding by way of written submissions, an officer may also choose to provide a 
questionnaire to the person concerned in order to facilitate the process and provide an 
information guideline to assist the person concerned.  
 
See Appendix C:  Sample Questionnaire 
 
Note: For submissions in writing, sufficient time shall be allowed for receipt by regular mail. or 
example, if the deadline for receipt is 15 days, an officer should not make a decision on day 15, 
but shall wait an additional seven days to allow for mail delays.  
 
Where the person concerned makes a request for an extension of time to provide 
submissions, the officer shall reasonably consider such a request, having full regard to the 
circumstances of the person concerned and the reasons for the request. The officer’s decision 
must be issued in writing and provided to the person concerned. 
 
As already noted, permanent residents (and foreign nationals who are no longer subject to 
examination) cannot be compelled to provide submissions or otherwise be required to 
participate in the A44(1) process. Where reasonable efforts have been made to ensure that the 
person concerned has been notified of the A44 process and no submissions are received or the 
person concerned has expressly declined to participate in the A44(1) process, the officer may 
proceed to write an A44(1) report based on all relevant evidence available and refer the report 
to be reviewed by an MD under A44(2).    
 
11.10 Procedure:  Failure to appear at A44(1) interview 
 
If the person concerned does not appear for an interview on the date specified in the call-in 
letter and the responsible officer and/or office where the A44(1) investigation originated has not 
received notice or other indication from the person concerned stating why they were unable to 
attend the interview, then officers should make reasonable efforts to locate the person, including 
reasonable efforts to determine the reasons for the no-show (e.g., letter to the last known 
address, site visit and/or telephone call). This will be particularly important in cases where the 
loss of appeal rights under A64 may be involved. 
 
In all cases where the loss of appeal rights under A64 may be involved, where the person 
concerned was not originally called in for an in-person interview, and no further 
submissions/information have been received within the specified timeframe, it is recommended 
that the officer attempt to interview the person concerned, either by telephone or in person, 
before taking further enforcement action. This will ensure that the person concerned is aware of 
the fact that they may not have appeal rights in their case should a removal order be issued. 
 
Where an interview is not possible because the person concerned refuses to meet or talk with 
an officer, the officer must keep a record of the efforts made to gather the information and the 
efforts to provide sufficient time for the person concerned to submit the information for 
consideration. 
 
Where, after making reasonable efforts, the officer has been unable to locate the person 
concerned and no correspondence or submissions have been received on their behalf, the 
officer may still proceed to write the A44(1) report based on all relevant evidence available and 
refer the report to be reviewed by an MD under A44(2).

12 Evidence gathering:  Additional considerations 
 
12.1 Serious inadmissibilities [A34, A35, A35.1, A36(1), A37] 
 
It is important to balance the requirement to gather information according to the considerations 
outlined in the preceding sections and the need to protect the safety of Canadian society. There 
may be cases where an officer is pursuing enforcement under the IRPA for serious 
inadmissibility and the person constitutes either a danger to the public or a significant flight risk. 
For example, criminal intelligence exists that the person is committing crimes of a violent nature, 
is a security risk or is involved in organized crime, etc. In such cases where an arrest and 
detention is necessary, it may be appropriate that the A44(1) report be written and a decision to 
refer the matter to the ID be made without advising the client prior to the arrest. In such 
exceptional cases, officers must first document their recommendation, consult with their 
manager regarding this proposed course of action and receive concurrence before proceeding. 
If an arrest takes place, the officer will then provide the individual with a copy of the A44(1) 
report. If the matter concerns a permanent resident or a protected person and they wish to 
make submissions at that point, the officers will provide them with a reasonable opportunity to 
do so and will forward the submission to the MD for review.  
 
12.2 Evidence of pending or withdrawn charges 
 
Officers must be careful about how they rely on evidence of charges which did not lead to a 
conviction. In McAlpin v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2018 FC 422, 
Chief Justice Crampton held that in exercising discretion to refer an individual for admissibility 
hearing, it is reasonable for the Minister or his delegate to place significant weight on the 
number of interactions that a person who is the subject of an A44(1) report has had with the law. 
Justice Crampton also found that while the Federal Court has previously found that pending or 
withdrawn charges may be considered by an officer or an MD in determinations under A44(1) 
and A44(2) and certain other contexts that arise under the IRPA, provided that such evidence is 
found to be credible and trustworthy14, officers must be mindful that there are limitations to the 
way such evidence is used and officers should not treat the existence of withdrawn charges on 
their face as evidence of a person’s history of criminality.   
 
Officers must also be careful not to rely on convictions for which rehabilitation or a record 
suspension has been granted as evidence of a criminal record. 
 
12.3 Offences under the Youth Criminal Justice Act  
 
Officers must ensure that they do not rely on or refer to youth offences in their determination, 
except where access is authorized under the Youth Criminal Justice Act (YCJA). Information 
that is not accessible under the provisions of the YCJA cannot be considered and must not be 
included or referenced at any point during A44 proceedings. Moreover, contravention of the 
provisions of the YCJA is a serious matter. 
 
The importance of verifying whether information is protected by YCJA provisions was 
highlighted in Abdi v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) 2017 FC 950. In 
                                               
14 Sittampalam v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FCA 326; Thuraisingam v 
Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2004 FC 607; Kharrat v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 
2007 FC 842 


===== PAGE 44 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
44 
 
 
that case, the Federal Court held that the MD did not commit an error in relying on youth crimes 
that the applicant was found guilty of where access to these records was not restricted by virtue 
of section 119(9) of the YCJA. However, the MD’s reliance on youth offences that were 
withdrawn or dismissed was unreasonable since section 119(2)(c) of the YCJA allows access to 
these records for only a brief period after dismissal or withdrawal of the youth charges and the 
access period to such charges had expired. 
 
Officers conducting A44(1) and A44(2) functions must ensure that they only rely on youth 
records to which access is not restricted under the YCJA. It is therefore important for officers to 
be aware of the provisions of the YCJA which relate to access to youth records.  
 
12.4 Privacy and information sharing 
 
While information sharing is vital to protecting the safety and security of Canadians, the sharing 
of information must be done in a manner which complies with Canada's laws and legal 
obligations. When obtaining and disclosing information obtained from a third party, including a 
foreign government, officers must be aware of their legal obligations under information sharing 
agreements and legislation. In all cases, officers are required to assess the accuracy and 
reliability of information received, and properly characterize this information in any further 
dissemination.  
 
All information sharing activities must also comply with the Security of Canada Information 
Disclosure Act (SCIDA)15. The SCIDA provides the authorities for all Government of Canada 
institutions respecting the disclosure of information related to national security, including 
personal information, in order to protect Canada against activities that undermine the security of 
Canada. 
 
When obtaining or assessing evidence at A44, officers must ensure that any and all information 
sharing activities comply with applicable information sharing legislation as well as all relevant 
departmental and agency information sharing policies. For further information, CBSA and IRCC 
officers should consult their respective Agency/Departmental information sharing guidance, 
policies and toolkits. 
 
12.4.1 Evidence obtained by mistreatment or torture 
 
In addition to ensuring that information is shared in a manner that complies with Canada's laws 
and legal obligations, officers must avoid knowingly contributing to mistreatment of persons by 
foreign entities. Bill C-59 gained Royal Assent in June 2019, thereby establishing the Avoiding 
Complicity in Mistreatment by Foreign Entities Act (ACA). Pursuant to subsection 3(2) of the 
ACA, a new Order in Council (OiC) issued to the CBSA in July 2019, which prescribes the 
directions for avoiding complicity in mistreatment by foreign entities. The OiC prohibits: 
 
• 
the disclosure of information that would result in a substantial risk of mistreatment of 
an individual by a foreign entity; 
• 
the making of requests for information that would result in a substantial risk of 
mistreatment of an individual by a foreign entity; and 
                                               
15 The Security of Canada Information Sharing Act (SCISA) was the previous legislation for national 
security information sharing. SCISA was amended and renamed SCIDA after Bill C-59, An Act respecting 
national security matters, received Royal Assent in June 2019.

• 
certain uses of information that was likely obtained through the mistreatment of an 
individual by a foreign entity. 
 
12.4.2 Disclosure and procedural fairness considerations 
 
Generally speaking, as a matter of procedural fairness, individuals subject to A44 proceedings 
have the right to know the case against them, which includes understanding what information 
the officer would rely on in making a decision. However, the Federal Court has recognized that 
each case must turn on its facts and that not every document considered by an officer must be 
disclosed at the A44 stage. The main question is whether the person has had the opportunity to 
meaningfully participate in the decision-making process [Karahroudi v Canada (Citizenship and 
Immigration), 2016 FC 522, [2017] 1 FCR 167; Gebremedhin v Canada (Minister of Citizenship 
and Immigration), 2013 FC 380; Bhagwandass v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and 
Immigration), 2001 FCA 49]. 
 
Officers should keep in mind that where there is relevant information before them which cannot 
be disclosed to the person due to privacy or information sharing legislation, and where the 
officer cannot obtain authorization to disclose the document with appropriate redactions, the 
information should not be relied upon in the officer’s reasons. There are exceptions where the 
duty of fairness can be met without having to furnish all the documents and reports the decision-
maker relied on, such as where a document is protected by privilege based on national security 
or on the solicitor-client relationship, however officers should be careful not to rely specifically 
on documents which cannot be disclosed. This position is consistent with Federal Court 
jurisprudence [for example, Moghaddam v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 
1063].   
 
Where officers receive a request for disclosure of documents at the A44(1) stage, officers 
should turn their minds to whether the information sought is “material and otherwise unknown 
and unavailable to the person concerned”. Where the information is not material (i.e., not 
being relied on in the offer’s assessment) or is otherwise known or available to the person 
concerned (e.g., a person’s criminal court records which they could access through a request), 
the officer is not subject to a duty to disclose and this may form the rationale for refusing to 
disclose it. An officer may still need to refuse to disclose on other grounds. In all cases, it is 
important for the officer to provide a rationale for the refusal. [for further information, see Durkin 
v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 174]. 
 
In Jeffrey v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 1180, the Federal 
Court relied on Durkin and concluded that the Minister does not have a duty to disclose 
information other than that which is “material and otherwise unknown or unavailable to the 
person” until after a decision has been made under A44(2) to hold an admissibility hearing. The 
court found that in the circumstances of the case, the officer was not subject to any duty to 
provide the disclosure sought by the applicant where the applicant was: 
 
advised of the reason why an inadmissibility report may be prepared pursuant to A44(1); 
 
informed of the nature of the specific allegations being considered; 
 
provided an opportunity to respond to those allegations;  
 
informed of what the relevant information in the officer’s possession consisted of; and  
 
advised that copies of the information sought would not be provided since the applicant 
either provided that information or was present during the interviews where the 
information was obtained. 
 


===== PAGE 46 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
46 
 
 
In other words, in responding to such requests for information, officers should ensure that the 
A44(1) procedure is fair. 
 
12.5 Allegations of inadmissibility subsequent to a declaration under A42.1 
 
A decision by the Minister to make a declaration under A42.1 means that the matters referred to 
in A34, A35(1)(b) or (c), or A37(1) do not constitute inadmissibility in respect of a foreign 
national, but only in respect of the facts that were reasonably available at the time the Minister 
made the declaration. Should a person who has been granted an exception pursuant to A42.1 
subsequently engage in activities that would render them inadmissible on the same or other 
grounds, or should new and material facts omitted from the record considered by the Minister as 
a result of an error or misrepresentation on the part of the person concerned come to the 
attention of the CBSA, an officer may prepare a report that sets out the relevant facts pursuant 
to A44(1). 
 
Before making an allegation that the person is inadmissible on the grounds of A34, A35(1)(b) or 
(c), or A37(1), an officer should ensure that the basis of the allegation does not include solely 
those facts that the Minister has already taken into consideration in granting a declaration under 
A42.1. 
 
 
 
13 Writing an A44(1) report –  Form and content 
 
13.1 A44(1) report requirements 
 
Officers should be mindful that the A44(1) report is not evidence. It sets out the allegation and 
the underlining facts necessary to support the allegation. The report should not contain 
information which is unrelated to the allegation (e.g., issues related to grounds for detention or 
the person’s full immigration history) or opinions of the officer and should be restricted to facts 
which support the allegation. 
  
Since the A44(1) report is an allegation, not evidence, any additional information obtained 
during an interview which an officer wishes to include in support of the report should be 
provided by way of a separate statutory declaration from the officer.  
 
The authority of the MD to cause an admissibility hearing or issue a removal order cannot be 
exercised unless the form and content of a report under A44(1) comply with specific 
requirements and contain required information relating to the IRPA inadmissibility upon which 
the report is based.  
 
When an officer is of the opinion that a permanent resident or foreign national in Canada is 
inadmissible, then that officer may prepare a report under A44(1). 
 
The report shall then be transmitted to the MD, along with any forms containing the officer’s 
disposition, recommendation and rationale. This may be best accomplished by preparing an 
A44(1) case highlights form IMM 5084B  (for inland cases) or BSF516 (for port of entry cases). 
For more complex cases, this may also be accomplished by way of a detailed memorandum or 
A44(1) narrative report (e.g., for permanent residents and protected persons).  See also: section 
14.2, ‘Referral of a report to the Minister’s Delegate’.

All A44(1) reports must: 
 
 
be in writing and must indicate the place and date of issue; 
 
be addressed to the Minister of PS or the Minister of IRCC and be signed by the officer who 
conducted the examination or is otherwise making the report; 
 
contain the complete name (correctly spelled) of the person who is being reported; 
 
contain the exact subsection(s)/paragraph(s) of the IRPA (and IRPR, if applicable) upon 
which the officer based the opinion that the person, who is the subject of the A44(1) report, 
is inadmissible; 
 
include a narrative section that justifies the inadmissibility opinion and cites the facts upon 
which that opinion is based. The narrative section must indicate the exact grounds for 
applying the particular inadmissibility section(s): these grounds are set out below the words:  
      “This report is based on the following information that the above-named individual:”. 
 
For example, in applying A36(2)(b), it is not sufficient to state that the person has been 
convicted of an offence. The report must fully specify the grounds of inadmissibility in the 
following manner: 
 
This report is based on the following information that the above-named individual:  
 
Also known as (list other names used, where applicable)  
-Is not a Canadian citizen; is not a permanent resident of Canada; is not a registered 
Indian under the Indian Act; 
…has been convicted of an offence; namely, [Possession of Cocaine] on or about [22 
November 1982] at or near [Pontiac, Michigan, USA]. This offence, if committed in 
Canada, would constitute an offence that may be punishable by way of indictment under 
paragraph 4(3)(a) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and for which a maximum 
term of imprisonment [not exceeding seven years] may be imposed. 
 
See also ENF 1 Inadmissibility; and ENF 2 Evaluating inadmissibility.    
                                                                                                                                     
13.2 Entering the A44(1) report into the Global Case Management System       
(GCMS)  
 
All A44(1) reports are generated in the Global Case Management System (GCMS) under the 
‘Examination’ process.   
  
Officers must take care to avoid errors during the data entry process as the written report is a 
legal document and may be closely scrutinized not only by the MD, but also by Hearings 
Officers, members of the IRB, and even Federal or Supreme Court of Canada justices. 
 
When officers enter a report into GCMS, they must ensure that the proper allegations are 
selected and that the dispositions of the examination process are accurately staged. Officers 
must review the contents of the narrative section of the report before finalizing the document. 
For technical instructions on GCMS processes and detailed instructions on how to enter a report 
into GCMS, officers should reference their IT Tools and guidelines. 
 
For CBSA officers, step by step instructions are available in the GCMS Help Centre.

Note:  Officers must also ensure that the report as well as the investigation process leading up 
to the report are recorded and updated in the National Case Management System (NCMS) in 
offices where NCMS is utilized. 
 
13.3 A44(1) reports for non-compliance with IRPA requirements – A41 
 
Under A41, a person is inadmissible for failing to comply with “this Act.” Pursuant to A2(2), 
unless otherwise indicated, references in the IRPA to “this Act” include the Regulations made 
under it. 
  
It is important to note that a non-compliance allegation must be coupled with a specific 
requirement of either the IRPA or the IRPR; it is not meant to be, nor should it be, a “stand-
alone” allegation. This means that the report must cite both A41 and the specific IRPA provision 
that is the subject of the non-compliance (i.e., provision of the IRPA or the IRPR contravened); 
this structure is necessary in order to determine whether the jurisdiction to issue a removal 
order falls under the MD (R228) or the ID (R229).   
 
Officers must also include the specific grounds for the non-compliance in the comments of the 
narrative portion of the A44(1) report, under the heading: “This report is based on the following 
information that the above-named individual:”. In other words, the description of the particular 
contravention of an IRPA requirement (e.g., person’s failure to leave Canada by the end of the 
period authorized for their stay) and any specific reference to a provision of the IRPA or the 
IRPR  are to be incorporated in the officer’s narrative justifying the inadmissibility allegation.  
 
For further information on the elements of non-compliance under A41, see ENF 2/OP18 
Evaluating Inadmissibility. 
 
13.4 Multiple allegations 
 
Where the person is inadmissible under multiple provisions of the IRPA, it is generally 
recommended that the officer writes a separate report for each allegation. The MD will then 
make a determination on each report during the A44(2) process.  
 
If an officer is considering whether to write two separate inadmissibility reports on the same 
person, and if the objectives of the IRPA would not be further served by pursuing a removal 
order for an additional allegation for which the ID has jurisdiction, then the officer may use 
discretion and not write an A44(1) report containing the allegation for which the ID has 
jurisdiction [R228(1) and R229(1)]. For example, an allegation may not be worth pursuing 
because it will not affect the eligibility of a claim for refugee protection under A101, or because 
the MD may issue an exclusion order based on the other allegations and there is no concern 
that the person will be able to return to Canada without consent after one year.  However, it is 
important to keep in mind the objectives of the IRPA: depending on the circumstances of the 
case, these objectives may be best served by writing an A44(1) report as a future record of the 
inadmissibility. In such cases, an officer may choose to write the A44(1) report but recommend 
no further action as the A44(2) disposition. 
 
There may be instances where an officer, after preparing or reviewing an A44(1) report, finds: 
 
 
that the grounds cited in the report are not valid, but in the officer’s opinion, the person 
falls within some other inadmissible class; or 


===== PAGE 49 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
49 
 
 
 
there is an additional ground of inadmissibility 
In such cases, the officer will need to prepare a new A44(1) report and forward the 
accompanying documents and evidence to the MD. The officer cannot simply amend the 
existing A44(1) report. Whether a new A44(1) report is written to replace a previous report or to 
report a new inadmissibility ground, in either case the officer must ensure that the person 
concerned is accorded the earliest possible notice of all the grounds against them in 
accordance with the rules of natural justice. 
 
If an officer, during the course of an investigation, comes across evidence to support new 
allegations which fall within the jurisdiction of the ID where an existing A44(1) report has already 
been referred to the ID, the officer should contact the Hearings Officer to determine next steps, 
including whether the additional grounds of inadmissibility should be dealt with at the hearing 
simultaneously.  
 
There may be instances where multiple allegations are contained within the same report. This 
practice is generally discouraged, especially where the jurisdiction for each inadmissibility does 
not lie with the same decision-maker (i.e., MD or ID). It should be noted, however, that where a 
report contains one or more inadmissibility allegation, and if the MD has jurisdiction for all 
inadmissibility allegations contained within that report, the MD can determine the disposition of 
that report. Conversely, where there are several inadmissibility allegations in a report and the 
MD has jurisdiction for only some of them, the MD is not authorized to determine a disposition 
for that report, and all allegations must be referred to the ID. 
 
As set out in section 8 above, discretion under A44 means that officers and MDs have some 
flexibility in managing cases where the person is inadmissible, and assessing whether the 
objectives of the IRPA may or will be achieved without the need to seek a removal order or write 
a formal inadmissibility report under A44(1). Officers should note, however, that where the same 
evidence supports multiple allegations of inadmissibility, they should consider the fact that not 
pursuing a particular allegation until a later date may give rise to an abuse of process argument 
by the person concerned. This does not mean an A44(1) report should be written in 
circumstances where the officer is still in the process of gathering further evidence in relation to 
one or more inadmissibility ground, and officers will need to balance whether the objectives of 
the IRPA would be served by writing a report for all possible allegations or proceeding with only 
certain allegations at a given point in time.  
 
Example:  A CBSA officer is investigating a permanent resident for inadmissibility for serious 
criminality under A36(1)(b). The CBSA officer has obtained evidence to support an A44(1) 
report for the allegation, but has determined that the evidence further supports an A44(1) report 
for A40(1)(a) based on misrepresentation on the person’s application for permanent residence. 
It may later be seen or determined by the Courts to be an abuse of process if the officer does 
not pursue the A40(1)(a) report at the same time as the A36(1)(b) report. On the other hand, 
using this same scenario as an example, if the officer is also investigating possible 
inadmissibility for organized criminality under A37(1)(a) but is still in the process of gathering 
evidence to establish this allegation, abuse of process is less likely to arise, even if there is 
overlapping evidence in both allegations. In this situation, however, the officer should consider 
whether to wait until the investigation into the A37(1)(a) allegation is complete before 
proceeding to write the report for A36(1)(b)/ referring it to the MD.

14 Procedures after the A44(1) report is written 
 
14.1 Providing the A44(1) report to the person concerned 
 
In order to comply with natural justice, persons who are reported under A44(1) should fully 
understand both the case against them, and the nature and purpose of the report. Wherever 
possible, an officer who writes an A44(1) report must also provide a copy of that report to the 
person concerned.  
 
In cases where a report is prepared as a consequence of an examination (such as at a port of 
entry) or in any other case where the person concerned is on site and/or otherwise available to 
receive a copy of the report, then a copy of the report should be given to the person concerned. 
In such cases, officers should also counsel a person who is the subject of an A44(1) report on 
the following matters, as appropriate:  
 
 
the reason why the report was prepared (or in the case of an R41 “Direct Back,” may 
be prepared); 
 
the date and time the person should return if the MD was not available to consider a 
report prepared (or that may be prepared) if the person chooses to return and pursue 
their entry request with respect to that person [R41(b)]; 
 
if the review by the MD is to be conducted at a place other than where the report was 
completed, appropriate instructions, such as where the office is located and how to 
get there; 
 
the purpose of the review and the options available to the MD. 
 
Where entry seems justified in the circumstances, officers should also inform persons about the 
option to apply for a TRP and about the cost recovery fee. For further information, see IP 1 
Temporary Resident Permits; and ENF 4 Port of entry examinations. 
 
For inland cases, where the MD has jurisdiction to issue the removal order, disclosure of the 
report may occur at the time of the MD review under A44(2). Where the ID has jurisdiction, 
disclosure of the report may occur at the time the admissibility hearing disclosure package is 
served on the person concerned. As mentioned in previous sections, the Federal Court of 
Appeal has confirmed that the duty of fairness does not require that the A44(1) report is put 
before the person before a decision is made by the MD to refer that report to the ID pursuant to  
A44(2) as long as the affected person is given an opportunity to make submissions and to know 
the case against them. (See also: section 11.9, ‘Procedure for submissions where no in-person 
interview is held: Persons no longer subject to examination’). 
 
14.2 Referral of the A44(1) report to the Minister’s Delegate  
   
All A44(1) reports concerning permanent residents and foreign nationals must be referred to the 
MD who will make the final decision about whether or not to issue a removal order (if within the 
MD’s jurisdiction) or refer the matter to the ID. Where the officer has also prepared an A44(1) 
case highlights form (IMM 5084B for inland cases or BSF516 for port of entry cases), a detailed 
memorandum or an A44(1) narrative report, this must also accompany the A44(1) report.  
Where the officer prepares one of these documents to set out their recommendation and 
rationale, such a document should include:  
 
• 
the person's identity, with name, aliases, date and place of birth, citizenship, marital 


===== PAGE 51 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
51 
 
 
status, present immigration status, and details of passports and travel documents; 
• 
the officer’s opinion based on the assessment of the criteria outlined in the sections 
above and the recommendation(s);  
• 
any submissions received from the person or notes taken at the interview; and, if 
applicable, the reasons for any delay in submitting the report. 
  
The officer must also forward, where applicable, any other documentation relied on by the 
officer, including but not limited to: 
 
• 
for permanent residents, proof of a search of citizenship records 
• 
copies of all relevant immigration documents and other certificates and affidavits that 
can be obtained from IRCC, if applicable; 
• 
originals or copies of other documents relevant to the case, such as a birth 
certificate, marriage certificate, a certificate of conviction or other evidence of a 
previous conviction that is acceptable in a court of law; 
• 
police occurrence reports; 
• 
probation, parole and psychiatric assessments; 
• 
police records and information on other convictions not reportable under A44(1); 
• 
details of the violations, and the first possible parole or release date if the person is 
serving a sentence; 
• 
other documentary evidence pertaining to the allegation(s), including all the evidence 
or submissions received from the person concerned. 
 
This means that even if the officer at A44(1) does not exercise their discretion to consider 
personal circumstances, all evidence and submissions received from the person concerned 
must still be forwarded to the MD. 
 
Note:  When submitting certificates of conviction, officers are to ensure that the conviction (as 
opposed to the original charge) meets the equivalency requirements of the inadmissibility 
allegation. 
 
See also, ENF 1 Inadmissibility; ENF 2 Evaluating inadmissibility; and ENF 23 Loss of 
permanent resident status. 
 
The importance of forwarding the officer’s recommendation to the MD at the same time as the 
A44(1) report was highlighted in Wong v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2011 FC 971.  
In that case, the Federal Court dealt with the legality of two removal orders issued by the MD 
prior to the A44 case highlights form being signed and dated. In finding that this sequence of 
events rendered the orders improperly issued and therefore null and void, the Court affirmed 
that the officer’s recommendation needed to be reviewed by the MD as part of the A44 process 
before a removal order was issued.     
 
It is in the officer’s recommendation and rationale [contained in the A44(1) case highlights form, 
detailed memorandum or A44(1) narrative report] that the officer will set out the recommended 
disposition to the MD at the 44(2) proceedings, including but not limited to: 
 
 
Issuance of a removal order by the MD (cases within MD jurisdiction under R228); 
 
Referral to the ID for an admissibility hearing (cases within ID jurisdiction under R229) 
 
Allowing withdrawal of application to enter Canada (Port of entry only); see section 9.4, 
‘Allowing withdrawal of application to enter Canada/ Allowed to leave (Port of entry   
   
cases)’;   


===== PAGE 52 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
52 
 
 
 
Issuance of a Temporary Resident Permit (TRP) (Port of entry only); for further 
information on TRPs, see section 9.7, ‘Temporary Resident Permits (TRPs) - Port of 
entry and IRCC only’; 
 
Issuance of a warning letter (inland- permanent residents and protected persons only); 
for further information on warning letters, see ENF 6 Review of reports under A44(2). 
 
14.3 Procedure: Referring A44(1) reports when a Minister’s Delegate is not on site 
 
The IRPA requires that A44(1) reports be transmitted to the MD after being prepared: officers 
cannot prepare and then review their own A44(1) report. There may be circumstances where an 
MD is not physically on site and/or otherwise available to conduct a review under A44(2) in 
person and where deferring the MD review is not a viable option.  In such circumstances, 
officers shall refer to ENF 6, section 10.7, ‘ Procedure: Reviewing A44(1) reports when a 
Minister’s Delegate is not on site’. 
 
14.4 Amending the A44(1) report 
 
There is no mechanism to directly amend an existing A44(1) report in GCMS, therefore at the 
time the report is being created, officers must ensure that the proper allegations are selected 
and the contents of the narrative section of the A44(1) report are accurate before finalizing the 
document.  
 
There are instances, however, where errors in an A44(1) report are identified following a review 
of the report after its issuance has been finalized. In such cases, it is important for officers to 
take appropriate steps to make necessary corrections, taking into account the nature of the 
error/information to be changed and the stage during which the error is identified.     
 
Where, following the issuance of the A44(1) report, an error is identified which does not affect 
the substance of the report (for example, a typographical error regarding the date of a 
conviction) or it is determined that a change is warranted with respect to the wording in the 
narrative section of the report, the officer who issued the original A44(1) report may write an 
updated report in GCMS reflecting the appropriate corrections prior to review by the MD. Where 
the error is discovered by the MD, it remains open to the MD to send the matter back to the 
officer so that appropriate corrections may be made or for the officer to consider writing a new 
A44(1) report. In such cases, where a new A44(1) report is written to replace an existing report, 
officers must ensure the previous report is cancelled in GCMS in accordance with the  
procedures set out in the GCMS guidelines, including the creation of any process notes as 
required. In such cases, the person concerned should be provided with a copy of the amended 
report in accordance with the procedural fairness requirements outlined in previous sections of 
these guidelines at some point prior to the proceeding that may result in the issuance of a 
removal order (e.g., Minister’s Delegate review or admissibility hearing). 
 
Note:  There is a specific process to be followed in GCMS where the MD decides to return the 
A44(1) to the officer. Based on errors or new information identified by the MD, the officer may 
create a new A44(1) report by following GCMS procedures for issuing a new A44 report after 
MD returns the report to an officer.  
 
CBSA officers may consult the GCMS Help Centre for guidance on GCMS procedures where 
the MD returns the A44 report to an officer.   
 
It is also important to note that there are circumstances in which amendments to an A44(1) 


===== PAGE 53 =====
ENF 5 Writing 44(1) Reports 
 
 
2025-02-20 
53 
 
 
report may be made after the report has been referred to the ID, without the need for a new 
referral under A44(2). While it is generally preferred that amendments be made by way of 
writing a new A44(1) report containing the amended wording, there may be circumstances 
where amendments to the report can be made at the admissibility hearing stage, however, this 
is only possible where the amendment does not affect the substance of the report. For example, 
in Clare v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2016 FC 545, the Minister filed a Notice of 
Amendment to the A44(1) report, after the report had already been referred to the ID. The notice 
itself stated that the amendment did not represent a change in the substance of the original 
report. The narrative section of the revised version replaced the reference to a particular 
subsection of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act with reference to a provision under the 
Criminal Code of Canada. The Federal Court found that the amendment to the A44(1) report did 
not need to be submitted to the MD for a fresh determination on a referral to the ID, so long as 
the amendment conformed generally to the description of the alleged illegal conduct in the 
original report and identified an offence that was punishable by a maximum of at least ten years 
imprisonment. Relying on Uppal v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 
338, the Federal Court found that the question was whether the amendment was so significant 
that it required a fresh consideration by the MD, and held that the ID had reasonably relied on 
the amended report because there was no substantive change in the description of the offence 
on which it was based. Moreover, the person concerned and his counsel were made aware of 
the amendment to the report at the outset of the hearing. 
 
On the other hand, it is important for officers to note that an A44(1) report cannot be amended 
at any point where further review reveals that the report contains a substantive error (e.g., 
wrong inadmissibility section under the IRPA). In addition, where further investigation leads to a 
finding that the grounds cited in the report are not valid but the person falls within some other 
inadmissible class, or identifies an additional ground of inadmissibility which the officer intends 
to pursue, the officer must write a new A44(1) report for a fresh referral to the MD. In such 
cases, where a new A44(1) report is written to replace an existing report, officers must ensure 
the previous examination case is cancelled in GCMS in accordance with required procedures, 
including the creation of any process notes where appropriate. Where substantive changes are 
made to the A44(1) report, officers must also ensure that the new report is provided to the 
person concerned in accordance with the procedural fairness requirements outlined in previous 
sections of these guidelines. 
 
14.5 Overview: Minister's opinions/interventions 
 
Identification of cases where an opinion under A115(2) of the Minister of IRCC for 
protected persons may be warranted  
  
Information may come to the attention of an officer in the course of an investigation of a person 
who is a protected person under A95(2) which the officer believes may warrant flagging the 
case for a future request for a Minister’s opinion under A115(2) that a person is a danger to the 
public in Canada, or should not be allowed to remain in Canada on the basis of the nature and 
severity of acts committed or of danger to the security of Canada.   
 
While such a request may not be made until the person has been found to be inadmissible 
under A34, A35, A35.1, A36(1) or A37 and becomes the subject of a removal order that is in 
force, officers at the A44(1) stage may flag the case for consideration for a future request for a 
Minister’s opinion in their recommendation to the MD, where appropriate. If a removal order is 
issued, the case can then be referred for consideration of a request for a Minister’s opinion in 
accordance with agency guidelines and local processes.

For further information, see ENF 28 Ministerial opinions on danger to the public, nature and 
severity of the acts committed and danger to the security of Canada. 
 
Intervention, cessation and vacation 
 
During the course of an A44(1) investigation, officers may have occasion to deal with 
information that may support a possible intervention in an outstanding claim for refugee 
protection, or a cessation or vacation application for a protected person or Convention refugee.  
 
If such is the case, the information should be brought to the attention of the appropriate 
Hearings unit where the information and/or evidence can be reviewed with respect to a potential 
application to the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the Immigration and Refugee Board 
(IRB). 
 
In some cases, an officer may receive information about a refugee claimant that could affect the 
decision of the RPD. If an officer becomes aware of new information relative to any of the 
inadmissibility provisions under A34 through A37, or where there is information to suggest that 
there is a substantive contradiction of any document or statement made by a refugee claimant, 
officers should: 
 
 
conduct an interview and take notes (see section 11. 6,  ‘Procedure:  End of 
examination for refugee claimants’;   
 
seize any relevant documents under A140(1) that could be used as evidence; 
 
update the National Case Management System (NCMS) to indicate that the case is 
under investigation and the reason(s) for the investigation; 
 
contact the appropriate Hearings unit to discuss case details; 
 
at the request of the Hearings Officer or Hearings Advisor, conduct a further 
investigation to collect additional evidence; 
 
when the investigation is complete, transfer the file and all supporting documentation 
to the Hearings Officer or Hearings Advisor with a memorandum outlining the case 
details. 
 
Note: following a decision of the RPD that refugee protection has ceased under A108(2), the 
Minister may not simply rely on a previous removal order (issued against the person before 
protected person status was granted) to remove that person. In other words, a new A44(1) 
report based on inadmissibility under A40.1(1) would need to be written and a new removal 
order would need to be issued by the MD in these circumstances. 
For further information, see ENF 24 Ministerial interventions. 
 
14.6 Imposition of conditions following the A44(1) report   
 
A44(3) authorizes officers to impose any conditions, including the posting of a deposit or the 
posting of a guarantee for compliance with conditions, that the officer considers necessary, on a 
permanent resident or foreign national who is the subject of an A44(1) report, an admissibility 
hearing or, being in Canada, a removal order.   
 
At the port of entry, this includes circumstances where the officer does not authorize entry to a 
foreign national and prepares an A44(1) report.

55 
 
 
 
For further information on deposits and guarantees, see ENF 8 Deposits and guarantees. 
 
Mandatory Circumstances (POE cases) 
 
There are also mandatory conditions which must be imposed at the port of entry pursuant 
R43(1) where the Border Services Officer adjourns an examination under A23: 
 
1. to report in person at the time and place specified for the completion of the      
    examination or the admissibility hearing; 
2. to not engage in any work in Canada; 
3. to not attend any educational institution; and 
4. to report in person to an officer at a POE, if the person withdraws their application to       
    enter Canada. 
 
Note:   A person whose examination has been deferred and who fails to report as required for 
continuation of their examination is reportable for non-compliance under A41(a). 
 
For further information, see ENF 4 Port of entry examinations and ENF 6 Review of reports 
under A44(2). 
  
Mandatory Circumstances (Prescribed Conditions for A34 inadmissibility) 
 
It is important for officers to note that under A44(4), the imposition of baseline conditions is 
mandatory by designated CBSA officials in cases of inadmissibility on security grounds under 
A34. For each of the circumstances outlined below, the prescribed conditions to be imposed are 
found in R250.1. 
 
CBSA officers should be aware that the prescribed conditions must be imposed by the 
designated CBSA authority in the following circumstances: 
 
 
when an inadmissibility report on grounds of security (A34) is referred to the ID and 
the subject of the report is not detained; 
 
when the subject of either an inadmissibility report on grounds of security (A34) that 
has been referred to the ID or a removal order for inadmissibility on grounds of 
security is released from detention. 
 
Note:  If the person is already subject to conditions imposed by the ID, an officer has no 
authority to vary or supersede an order previously issued by the ID. Generally speaking, the ID 
retains jurisdiction with respect to the variation of previous terms and conditions imposed by the 
ID.  In circumstances where an officer believes that previously imposed conditions by the ID are 
no longer required or are insufficient to ensure compliance, but may not necessarily require that 
the person be re-arrested first, officers will refer the file to the appropriate Hearings unit, 
articulating the need to amend the existing conditions and request that a Hearings Officer make 
a request to the ID to vary the order.

Ref:  UCI/File #: 
 
(Date)   
 
Dear XXXX (given name and surname of person concerned); 
 
This is to advise you that a report under subsection 44(1) of the Immigration and Refugee 
Protection Act may be prepared alleging that you are inadmissible to Canada under paragraph 
XXX of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. 
(Insert IRPA wording here) 
 
If a report is prepared, the Minister’s Delegate may cause an admissibility hearing to be held, 
which could result in a removal order being issued, or the Minister’s Delegate may issue a 
removal order in certain cases.  
A decision to allow you to remain in Canada or to seek to have a removal order issued against 
you will be made in the near future. The next step in the process is to conduct a review of the 
circumstances surrounding your alleged inadmissibility.   
 You may provide relevant evidence or submissions that you wish to be considered in relation to 
this matter of your admissibility to Canada. You should be aware that this office may obtain 
additional information pertaining to the alleged inadmissibility from other sources, such as 
reports prepared by other enforcement agencies.  
Please note that any documentation that you choose to submit must be in English or French.

(Date)   
 
Dear XXXX (given name and surname of person concerned; 
 
This is to advise you that a report under subsection 44(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act 
may be prepared alleging that you are inadmissible to Canada under paragraph XXX of the Immigration 
and Refugee Protection Act. 
(Insert IRPA wording here) 
If a report is prepared, the Minister’s Delegate may cause an admissibility hearing to be held, which 
could result in a removal order being issued, or the Minister’s Delegate may issue a removal order in 
certain cases. A decision on whether you are inadmissible to Canada or not and whether the officer will 
seek to have a removal order issued against you will be made in the near future. The next step in the 
process is to conduct a complete review of the circumstances surrounding your alleged inadmissibility. 
In order to fully assess the circumstances of your case and provide you with an opportunity to respond 
to any concerns the Minister may have, you are requested to attend an interview on: 
(Insert Date and time) at (CBSA office address) 
The purpose of the interview will be to discuss your alleged inadmissibility to Canada and to provide you 
with an opportunity to respond to any concerns the officer may have.  As part of this process, you may 
make submissions and present any relevant information and documentation related to your 
admissibility to Canada.  
You should be aware that this office may obtain information from other sources, such as reports 
prepared by other enforcement agencies. You may wish to address your history with other agencies at 
the interview.  
Any relevant information that you choose to submit will be considered at the time your case is 
reviewed.  Please note that any documentation that you submit must be in English or French.  
 
Depending on the circumstances of your case, you may or may not have the right to appeal to the 
Immigration Division should a removal order be issued against you. Subsection 64(1) of the Immigration 
and Refugee Protection Act states that: 


===== PAGE 68 =====

64(1) No appeal may be made to the Immigration Appeal Division by a foreign national or their sponsor or by a 
permanent resident if the foreign national or permanent resident has been found to be inadmissible on grounds of 
security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality or organized criminality. 
64(2) For the purpose of subsection (1), serious criminality must be with respect to a crime that was punished in 
Canada by a term of imprisonment of at least six months or that is described in paragraph 36(1)(b) or (c). 
 
Please confirm your attendance upon receipt of this letter. If you require the services of an interpreter, 
please inform the officer and an interpreter will be arranged for you.  
Please be advised that you may have counsel present with you during the interview. Please note that 
the Agency is not responsible for legal fees and that you must assume all the costs of the legal counsel 
yourself. Additionally, the Agency reserves the right to exclude your counsel from the interview if they 
are found to be disruptive or disrespectful. 
Please be advised that should you fail to report for this interview, a decision will be made based on 
the information available on file and an admissibility report may be referred to the Minister’s 
Delegate without the benefit of your comments and submissions.   
Please quote your file number on all correspondence with this office.
