It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nThere are two streams under this Labour Market Impact Assessment(LMIA)-exemption category.\n\nEmergency repair personnel are persons whose admission is required in Canada to carry out emergency repairs to industrial or commercial equipment in order to prevent disruption of employment regardless of whether the equipment is under warranty. They require work permits, and are exempt from an LMIA.\n\n### Documentation requirements\n\nThe onus is on the applicant to provide evidence that they meet the requirements of the work being sought. Documentary evidence may include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n* letter of introduction from the home employer (i.e., foreign employer) outlining the applicant’s status with the company and the purpose of the foreign national’s visit to Canada;\n* a copy of the completed and submitted _Offer of Employment to a Foreign National Exempt from a Labour Market Impact Assessment(LMIA)_ form [IMM 5802] (formerly known as the job offer letter) from the Canadian entity that \n * explains (under the Details of Job section of the IMM 5802 form) their need to conduct **emergency repairs** on industrial or commercial equipments, and\n * provides a detailed description of the work to be performed in Canada;\n\n* evidence to demonstrate that the foreign national has the proprietary or specialized knowledge required to repair the equipment (e.g., copies of degrees, any required professional licences or certifications, a copy of the foreign national’s curriculum vitae).\n\nRepair personnel for out-of-warranty equipment\n----------------------------------------------\n\nEffective May 21,2015, the LMIA-exempt category C-13 has been **expanded** to include individuals who are coming to Canada to repair industrial or commercial equipment that is no longer under warranty or covered by an after-sales or lease agreement. This amendment is necessary to allow for preventative work where failure to repair industrial equipment immediately would have a negative impact on productivity.\n\nThe admission of repair personnel and service technicians will typically be permitted for a short duration (i.e., less than 30 calendar days).\n\n### When the service is required\n\nThe service of repair personnel is required when\n\n* there is a need for specific knowledge;\n* there is no commercial presence by the company that manufactured the equipment being serviced (also known as the Original Equipment Manufacturer[OEM]); **and**\n* Canadian jobs would be greatly affected if the equipment is not repaired in a timely fashion.\n\n### Documentation requirements\n\nThe onus is on the applicant to provide evidence that they meet the requirements to perform the work being sought. Documentary evidence may include, but is not limited to, the following:\n\n* letter of introduction from the home employer (i.e., foreign employer) outlining the foreign national’s status with the company and the purpose of their visit to Canada; \n* a copy of the completed and submitted _Offer of Employment to a Foreign National Exempt from a Labour Market Impact Assessment(LMIA)_ form [IMM 5802] (formerly known as the job offer letter) from the Canadian entity that \n * indicates the nature of their work;\n * explains their need to conduct repairs on industrial or commercial equipment that is no longer under warranty;\n * confirms that there is no OEM presence in Canada who could perform the work; and\n * provides a detailed description of the work to be performed in Canada;\n\n* evidence demonstrating that the foreign national has the proprietary or specialized skills and knowledge required to repair the equipment (e.g., copies of degrees, any required professional licences or certifications, a copy of the curriculum vitae).\n\n### Extension of work permit\n\nIn most cases, the duration for the time requested by the Canadian entity will be for less than one month (i.e., 30 calendar days).\n\nIn exceptional circumstances, an officer could assess an application to extend the work permit on a case-by-case basis where the work performed would create or maintain significant economic benefits or opportunities for Canadian citizens and permanent residents. For such cases, the Canadian entity/employer is required to submit supporting rationale to explain why the work could not be completed within the original timeframe.\n\n### Applications received before May 21, 2015\n\nApplications received before May 21, 2015, (00:01 EST) will be processed according to requirements in place at the time the work permit application was received. If an LMIA was received with the work permit application, the application will be assessed with an LMIA.\n\nFees\n----\n\nEmployers who bring foreign nationals to work temporarily in Canada through the International Mobility Program are required to complete and submit the _Offer of Employment to a Foreign National Exempt from a Labour Market Impact Assessment(LMIA)_ form [IMM 5802] and are required to pay a $230.00 employer compliance fee **before** the worker can apply for a work permit. The [work permit processing fee](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/immigration/work-permit-r196-r299-1.html) should be paid separately when the foreign national applies for a work permit.
