It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nOn [January 31, 2025](https://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2025/2025-02-12/html/sor-dors11-eng.html), new authorities regarding individual cancellation of temporary resident documents came into force.\n\nThese regulatory changes give designated officers explicit authority to cancel electronic travel authorizations (eTAs), temporary resident visas (TRVs), work permits (WPs) and study permits (SPs) on a case-by-case basis.\n\nThese instructions apply to IRCC employees only.\n\nThese instructions apply to **immigration documents only**, not to applications.\n\n**Note:** These individual cancellation authorities are separate from changes implemented on [March 15, 2024](https://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2024/2024-02-14/html/sor-dors11-eng.html) that automatically cancel in GCMS by operation of law TRVs, eTAs, and temporary resident permits (TRP) when a removal
