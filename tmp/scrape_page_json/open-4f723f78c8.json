It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nAn open work permit can only be issued to a foreign national under one of the International Mobility Program (IMP) administrative codes.\n\nThe instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with\n\n* [Conditions and validity period on work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html)\n\nAn open work permit enables a person to work for any employer in Canada for a specified period of time. An open restricted permit may restrict the occupation or location but not the employer.\n\n**Note:** Although there are no restrictions on the open work permit concerning the employer name, the foreign national is still subject to the general conditions imposed on all temporary residents under [subsection 183(1)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-183.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations(IRPR), including paragraph R183(1)(b.2), which states that the foreign national cannot work for an employer who is ineligible (see [Public list of employers who have been non-compliant](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/public-list-employers-who-have-been-non-compliant.html)).\n\nOpen work permit holders also cannot enter into or extend an employment agreement with an employer who, on a regular basis, offers striptease, erotic dance, escort services or erotic massage.\n\nA foreign national may apply for an open work permit outside Canada, at a port of entry or after arrival to Canada, as per program requirements.\n\nOn this page\n------------\n\n* [Types of open work

of open work permits\n--------------------------\n\nThere are 2 types of open work permits:\n\n* unrestricted\n* restricted, which can mean \n * occupational restrictions, for example, depending on the applicant’s medical status [[R185(b)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-185.html)] or [work permit

examination](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/medical-requirements/exam.html) with a result of M1, M2 or M3 (medical examination passed), or who has failed the medical examination due to excessive demand concerns (M5) but satisfies the criteria of [section R206](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-206.html) or [paragraph R207(c) or (d)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-207.html).\n\n**Note:**[Medical surveillance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/medical-requirements/surveillance-notifications.html) must be imposed for persons whose surveillance code is S.2.02 or S2.02U. Remarks on the permit should indicate “medical surveillance required.”\n\nRefer to: [Who must submit to an immigration medical exam.](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/medical-requirements/exam/who-must-submit-immigration-medical-examination.html)\n\nOpen work permit issuance in GCMS: Occupation or location restricted\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOn the Application screen, enter the following:\n\n Location restriction | Field | Mandatory | Selection or input |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Province of destination | Yes | Enter the province employment is restricted to as per the requirements of the LMIA exemption category.

If the condition is controlled, a new medical examination is required before a work permit may be issued.\n\n### Medical conditions to be imposed for occupation-restricted work permits\n\nIf a medical examination **was not completed**, one of the conditions below **must** be imposed. The specific occupational sector restriction will depend on whether the person has resided in a [designated or non-designated country](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents/country-requirements.html).\n\nFor persons from **non-designated** countries, the following condition should appear on the work permit:\n\n“Not authorized to work in 1) child care, 2) primary or secondary school teaching, 3) health services field occupations.”\n\nFor persons from **designated** countries, the following condition should appear on the work permit:\n\n“Not authorized to work in 1) child care, 2) primary or secondary school teaching, 3) health services field occupations, 4) agricultural occupations.”\n\n**Note:** For clarity, “occupations” in the medical condition as written in GCMS means “settings” as per the [If the duration of the visit is six months or less](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/medical-requirements/exam/who-must-submit-immigration-medical-examination.html#less-six) instructions. For example, all occupations in a hospital from janitor to doctor require a medical exam, not just those who are in health service occupations, and all employees in a day care require a medical exam, not just the teachers.\n\nSubmission of open work permit applications for various International Mobility Program (IMP) categories\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn addition to having to meet the requirements of who can apply at the port of entry [R198] and who can apply after entry [R199], some LMIA exemption categories have restrictions on where the person can submit their application for a open work permit.\n\n**Note:** This list is not exhaustive and only contains examples of exemption categories under sections R204 to R208 and certain public policies.\n\nFor further instructions on issuing open work permits under a public policy or a pilot program, see [International Mobility Program: Special initiatives and pilot

a [fee be payable](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/immigration/work-permit-r196-r299-1.html) by a person for the rights and privileges conferred by means of an open work permit **only** if that person\n\n* is intending to perform work under section R204 or R205\n* is described in paragraph R207(b) **and** does not have an offer of employment\n* is a family member of a foreign national referred to in paragraph R207(b)\n\nThere are exceptions to the payment of the open work permit holder fee for specific persons. [Subsection R303.2(2)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-303.2.html) provides the list of exceptions.\n\n**Important:** If the person applying for an open work permit is not as described above, then they do not have to pay the fee. It is not that they are exempt but that the fee is not applicable at all.\n\nIf they have paid the fee in error, it must be refunded as the department has no legal authority to collect the funds.\n\n### Fee exemption codes\n\n**P01:** Persons who do not pay a work permit processing fee under the IRPR, with the exception of International Experience Canada participants.\n\n**P02:** Members of the live-in caregiver class in Canada who have applied for permanent residence under paragraph R207(a), and their family members.\n\n**P03:** Persons not listed in subsection R303.2(1) as required to pay the fee. They are not “exempt” from the fee as they are not required to pay it at all.\n\n* Open work permits issued based on LMIA exemptions under section R206 (S61 or S62) or R208 (H81 or H82) are **not** subject to the open work permit holder fee. These sections are not included in the regulation applying the fee.\n* Open work permits issued under section 25.2 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (public policy or special measure) are not subject to the open work permit holder fee.\n\nWork permit application refusals\n--------------------------------\n\nWhen the officer’s decision is to refuse the open work permit application, they should clearly state what eligibility or admissibility requirements are not met and why they are not satisfied.

of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations(IRPR), including paragraph R183(1)(b.2), which states that the foreign national cannot work for an employer who is ineligible (see [Public list of
