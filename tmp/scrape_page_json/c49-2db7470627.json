Although there is no standard minimum hours required, officers have to be satisfied the **principal** foreign national’s wages or available funds will be sufficient to financially support themselves and their family members while they are in Canada.\n\nApplications received as a family group\n---------------------------------------\n\nIf the family members and the principal foreign national are applying together as a family group, the principal foreign national’s application must be assessed first. The principal family members application in the group may be considered as **documentary evidence** of the authority or provisional approval to work in Canada and the requirement of 6-month duration.\n\nIf the principal foreign national is eligible and admissible, then the dependent family members are assessed for eligibility and admissibility – when they all receive a positive assessment, then the officer will enter [Final Decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c49.html#decision) in GCMS.\n\nIf the principal foreign national’s work permit application is refused, the work permit applications of family members will be refused for not meeting the requirements of this category.\n\nIf the family group is approved, the principal foreign national must enter Canada before or together with their family members. The dependent family member cannot arrive in Canada prior to the entry of the principal foreign national.\n\nPrincipal foreign nationals and family members applying as a family group in Canada must meet the requirements of R199.\n\nApplication assessment\n----------------------\n\nOfficers must be satisfied that all eligibility requirements are **met at the time of decision** on the family member work permit application. **Mandatory association to the principal foreign national:** The family member must be associated with the principal foreign national in GCMS. Association should be completed on the Client screen and not just within the application.\n\nThis is required to ensure the ability to revoke a family member work permit under [public policy considerations](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/revocation-work-permit-public-policy-considerations.html).\n\nIf officers have any concerns as to the genuineness of documents provided, they may wish to undertake an assessment to ensure this material information is genuine and does not reflect a direct misrepresentation of facts in order to appear eligible for the permit.\n\n### Principal foreign national\n\nThe principal foreign national is the **first** foreign national in the couple who has submitted an application for a permanent residence and applied for and obtained a work permit.\n\nIn assessing eligibility for a family member open work permit, the principal foreign national continues to remain the principal in the couple and cannot obtain a spousal open work permit under R205(c) off of the spousal open work permit of their spouse.\n\nFor example, if the principal foreign national is the holder of a bridging open work permit issued under the administrative code A75 and the dependent spouse obtains an open work permit under LMIA exemption code C49 as the spouse of a worker who is a permanent resident applicant, and the spouse is working in an employment in a TEER category 4 or 5 occupation, the principal foreign national cannot obtain an openwork permit in the low-skilled spousal category (code C47) on the basis of their spouse’s C49 open work permit and employment in a TEER category 4 or 5 occupation.\n\n**Important:** Dependent children cannot be the principal foreign national as per the definition in subsection R1(3).\n\nGenuine relationship\n--------------------\n\nAs per [section R4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-4.html), a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse or a common-law partner of a person if the marriage or common-law partnership\n\n* was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act; or\n* is not genuine\n\nIf officers have concerns as to the genuineness of the relationship, they may request further documentation or information to confirm that the relationship between the dependent spouse or common-law partner and the principal foreign national is genuine and is not a relationship of convenience.\n\n### Dependent children and working age\n\nThere is no set minimum age to be eligible for a work permit. The submission of work permit applications on behalf of minor children is at the discretion of their parent(s) or authorized guardian(s).\n\nThe ‘working age’ varies across provincial and territorial jurisdictions and there is no minimum age for work permit issuance specified in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) or its regulations.\n\nAs such, unless there are reasonable grounds for an officer to be satisfied that a dependent child is unable to perform the work sought or any other reasons for refusal, minors may be issued a work permit.\n\nIRCC and CBSA officers **are not required** to assess the minimum age requirements in the province of destination for dependent children. Therefore, the onus is on the Canadian employers to meet the requirements of the labour laws of the province of destination.\n\nPlease refer to the PDIs on [Who qualifies as a dependent child](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/non-economic-classes/dependent-children.html#assessing_dependent_children) to confirm if an applicant meets the definition of a dependent child in relation to the principal applicant.\n\nThe child must meet the definition of dependent child when we receive the work permit application **and** at time of decision.\n\n### Final decision\n\n#### Approval\n\nThe work permit will be issued under the authority of R205(c)(ii).\n\nIn the Global Case Management System (GCMS) under the Application screen, officers should enter the information below in the specified fields:\n\n| Field | Selection or input |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case Type | 20 |\n| Province of destination | Unknown **Important:** For applications for family members of a provincial nominee or CSQ holder, the province of nomination or selection should be completed, and not left as ‘unknown’. |\n| Exemption code | C49 - Family member of an Economic permanent resident applicant |\n| Employer | Open |\n| Intended Occupation | Open |\n| NOC | 99999 |\n| Duration | The open work permit may be issued for a period that ends no later than the period of authorized stay of the principal foreign national or the date the applicant’s passport expires, whichever comes first. If the principal foreign national is authorized to work without a permit under [paragraph R186(u)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) at the time the family member’s work permit application is submitted, the application should be placed on hold until the principal foreign national’s work permit renewal application is assessed. |\n| Conditions | Officers should ensure that instructions provided in [Work permit issuance in GCMS: Occupation or location restricted](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html#conditions-restricted) and [Medical conditions to be imposed for occupation-restricted work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html#issuance-restricted) are followed. For example, the work permit of family members of provincial nominees or CSQ holders must be restricted by the province (**not by the city**). This condition should be added: **Not authorized to work at any other location**. |\n| **User Remarks** **(Mandatory)** | The following remark must be added to all open work permits **Authorized to work as per applicable labour laws.** |\n| Fees | $155 work permit processing fee $100 open work permit holder fee |\n| Biometrics | Work permit applicants are required to provide biometric information and pay the biometric fee – $85 The regular biometric exemptions apply (for example, age or 1 in 10). |\n\n#### Refusals\n\nIf an officer has determined that the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements. They should record their reasons for decision as per the instructions in: [Decision making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html).\n\nPrevious updates\n----------------\n\n[July 13, 2023](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/updates/2023-public-policy-competitiveness-economy-imp.html)\n\n[January 30, 2023](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/updates/2023-policy-competitiveness-economy-imp.html)\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2025-02-03",

The principal family members application in the group may be considered as **documentary evidence** of the authority or provisional approval to work in Canada and the requirement of 6-month duration.\n\nIf the principal foreign national is eligible and admissible, then the dependent family members are assessed for eligibility and admissibility – when they all receive a positive assessment, then the officer will enter [Final Decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c49.html#decision) in GCMS.\n\nIf the principal foreign national’s work permit application is refused, the work permit applications of family members will be refused for not meeting the requirements of this category.\n\nIf the family group is approved, the principal foreign national must enter Canada before or together with their family members.
