  "text": "Published Time: Thu, 12 Feb 2026 00:41:35 GMT\n\nBilateral agreements and arrangements: International Experience Canada (IEC) – [R204(d) – C21] – Reciprocity – International Mobility Program (IMP)\n===================================================================================================================================================\n\nThis section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nIn these instructions “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency.\n\nThere are 3 possible categories of participation through bilateral agreements and arrangements under the International Experience Canada (IEC) Program:\n\n* **Working Holiday** (travel and work): Participants are eligible to apply for an open work permit that will allow them to work for any employer at any location in Canada to subsidize their stay as they travel and discover the country.\n* **Young Professionals** (career development): Participants are eligible to apply for an [employer-specific work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html)that will help them gain professional work experience in Canada.\n* **International Co-op (Internship)** (internships for students only): Participants are eligible to apply for an [employer-specific work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html)that will help them gain experience in their field of study.\n\nOn this page\n------------\n\n* [Discontinuance requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/international-experience/canadian-interests-reciprocal-employment-international-experience-canada-bilateral-agreements-arrangements.html#discontinuance)\n* [Program requirements specific to each country or territory](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/international-experience/canadian-interests-reciprocal-employment-international-experience-canada-bilateral-agreements-arrangements.html#program)\n\nDiscontinuance requirements\n---------------------------\n\nWhere there is a discontinuance requirement (meaning a specific length of discontinuous stay, specified in the agreement), the discontinuous stay will be calculated from the expiry of the first work permit.\n\nFor IEC, even though there are discontinuation clauses under the youth mobility agreements (YMAs), the clauses only apply between one IEC participation and the next IEC participation. If a foreign worker has finished their IEC participation and has applied for a work permit renewal in another work permit category, the discontinuation clause in the YMA doesn’t apply. For more information, consult [International Experience Canada (IEC) program participants changing work permit categories](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/authorization-work-without-work-permit-implied-status.html#Toc4).\n\nFor clients with dual citizenship, discontinuance only applies if the youth is participating consecutively under the same citizenship.\n\nApplications for work permits in the IEC Program are always submitted “outside of Canada” and therefore do not meet the requirements for[maintained status](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/implied-status-extending-stay.html)for an extension of stay under[subsection 183(5) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-183.html). IEC work permit applications do not meet the requirements for work without a permit under[paragraph R186(u)](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html)either.\n\nProgram requirements specific to each country or territory\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nDescribed below are the program requirements specific to each country or territory that holds a bilateral agreement or arrangement with Canada’s IEC Program:\n\nView list by country or territory\n\n* All\n* Andorra\n* Australia\n* Austria\n* Belgium\n* Chile\n* Costa Rica\n* Croatia\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hong Kong\n* Iceland\n* Ireland\n* Italy\n* Japan\n* Latvia\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Netherlands\n* New Zealand\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* San Marino\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* South Korea\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Taiwan\n* United Kingdom\n\nView list by country or territory \n\n### Andorra\n\nApplicants are allowed **1** participation under the bilateral agreement.\n\n| Available categories | Age eligibility | Type of work permit | Maximum validity period | Discontinuance requirement | Residence requirements |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Working Holiday | 18 to 30 years | Open | 12 months | No specific requirement | No specific requirements |\n\n### Australia\n\nApplicants are allowed **2**participations under the bilateral agreement:\n\n* 1 participation of up to 24 months in either the Working Holiday or Young Professional category\n* 1 participation of up to 12 months in the International Co-op (Internship) category\n\n| Available categories | Age eligibility | Type of work permit | Maximum validity period | Discontinuance requirement | Residence requirements |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| Working Holiday | 18 to 35 years | Open | 24 months | No specific requirement | No specific requirements |\n| Young Professionals (graduates) | 18 to 35 years | Employer-specific | 24 months | No specific requirement | No specific requirements |\n| International Co-op (work placements) International Co-op (inter-institutional work-study agreement) | 18 to 35 years | Employer-specific | 12 months (unless it is the applicant’s second participation since 2015, in which case, 24 months) | No specific requirement | The student must be registered at a school in Australia at the time of application. |\n\n**Note:** Australian citizens who participated in the program prior to the 2015 quota year are eligible for 1 final participation in the category of their choosing.

These youth are assigned to the international branches and subsidiaries of French-based companies. The primary objective of this program is the professional training of high-achieving French youth through international exposure. This allows them to boost their professional development and nurture potential future professional relationships between themselves and the host country.\n\nBusiness France, the Government of France’s business export development and promotion agency, manages the VIE program. French youth participating in VIE do not receive either a salary or wages but rather a stipend or monthly allowance paid to them directly in France by Business France. This allowance helps VIE participants to cover the cost of living in their host country while also maintaining residential ties to France. VIE participants are to return to France upon completion of their assignment. Business France also guarantees that VIE participants do not become a financial burden for their host country by providing housing and covering any health-care costs.\n\n### Germany\n\nApplicants are allowed **2** participations under the bilateral agreement.

As of December 11, 2023, citizens of the Republic of Korea may participate in International Experience Canada twice. Previous participation will count toward the total number of participations allowed. For example, if a candidate submitted an application before December 11, 2023, the terms of the old agreement apply (they are limited to a 12-month work permit). However, those candidates can apply for a second (and final) participation of up to 24 months under the Working Holiday, Young Professionals or International Co-op category.\n\n### Spain\n\nApplicants are allowed **2** participations under the bilateral agreement.

Modelled after the French Volontariat international en entreprise (VIE) program, ICEX Vives offers graduate internships to youth with companies legally incorporated in Spain, including subsidiaries, branches and representative offices in Canada. Its primary objective is to provide business development training to Spanish youth.\n\nICEX manages the Vives program through its offices in Spain. Spanish youth participating in the program do not receive a salary or wages, but they receive a grant paid to them directly by ICEX. The amount is determined according to the city and country of destination, ranging from €21,300 to €42,800 (approximately CAD 31,000 to CAD 62,000 as of December 2022). This allowance helps Vives participants cover round-trip travel expenses as well as living expenses in their host country. Vives participants are also provided with accident and travel insurance for the duration of their internships. Vives participants are to return to Spain upon completion of their placement.\n\n### Sweden\n\nApplicants are allowed **2** participations under the bilateral agreement.

It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nIn these instructions “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency.\n\nThere are 3 possible categories of participation through bilateral agreements and arrangements under the International Experience Canada (IEC) Program:\n\n* **Working Holiday** (travel and work): Participants are eligible to apply for an open work permit that will allow them to work for any employer at any location in Canada to subsidize their stay as they travel and discover the country.\n* **Young Professionals** (career development): Participants are eligible to apply for an [employer-specific work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html)that will help them gain professional work experience in Canada.\n* **International Co-op (Internship)** (internships for students only): Participants are eligible to apply for an [employer-specific work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html)that will help them gain experience in their field of study.\n\nOn this page\n------------\n\n* [Discontinuance requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/international-experience/canadian-interests-reciprocal-employment-international-experience-canada-bilateral-agreements-arrangements.html#discontinuance)\n* [Program requirements specific to each country or territory](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/international-experience/canadian-interests-reciprocal-employment-international-experience-canada-bilateral-agreements-arrangements.html#program)\n\nDiscontinuance requirements\n---------------------------\n\nWhere there is a discontinuance requirement (meaning a specific length of discontinuous stay, specified in the agreement), the discontinuous stay will be calculated from the expiry of the first work permit.\n\nFor IEC, even though there are discontinuation clauses under the youth mobility agreements (YMAs), the clauses only apply between one IEC participation and the next IEC participation. If a foreign worker has finished their IEC participation and has applied for a work permit renewal in another work permit category, the discontinuation clause in the YMA doesn’t apply. For more information, consult [International Experience Canada (IEC) program participants changing work permit categories](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/authorization-work-without-work-permit-implied-status.html#Toc4).\n\nFor clients with dual citizenship, discontinuance only applies if the youth is participating consecutively under the same citizenship.\n\nApplications for work permits in the IEC Program are always submitted “outside of Canada” and therefore do not meet the requirements for[maintained status](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/implied-status-extending-stay.html)for an extension of stay under[subsection 183(5) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-183.html). IEC work permit applications do not meet the requirements for work without a permit under[paragraph R186(u)](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html)either.\n\nProgram requirements specific to each country or territory\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nDescribed below are the program requirements specific to each country or territory that holds a bilateral agreement or arrangement with Canada’s IEC Program:\n\nView list by country or territory\n\n* All\n* Andorra\n* Australia\n* Austria\n* Belgium\n* Chile\n* Costa Rica\n* Croatia\n* Czech Republic\n* Denmark\n* Estonia\n* Finland\n* France\n* Germany\n* Greece\n* Hong Kong\n* Iceland\n* Ireland\n* Italy\n* Japan\n* Latvia\n* Lithuania\n* Luxembourg\n* Netherlands\n* New Zealand\n* Norway\n* Poland\n* Portugal\n* San Marino\n* Slovakia\n* Slovenia\n* South Korea\n* Spain\n* Sweden\n* Switzerland\n* Taiwan\n* United Kingdom\n\nView list by country or territory"

These youth are assigned to the international branches and subsidiaries of French-based companies. The primary objective of this program is the professional training of high-achieving French youth through international exposure. This allows them to boost their professional development and nurture potential future professional relationships between themselves and the host country.\n\nBusiness France, the Government of France’s business export development and promotion agency, manages the VIE program. French youth participating in VIE do not receive either a salary or wages but rather a stipend or monthly allowance paid to them directly in France by Business France. This allowance helps VIE participants to cover the cost of living in their host country while also maintaining residential ties to France. VIE participants are to return to France upon completion of their assignment. Business France also guarantees that VIE participants do not become a financial burden for their host country by providing housing and covering any health-care costs."

Its primary objective is to provide business development training to Spanish youth.\n\nICEX manages the Vives program through its offices in Spain. Spanish youth participating in the program do not receive a salary or wages, but they receive a grant paid to them directly by ICEX. The amount is determined according to the city and country of destination, ranging from €21,300 to €42,800 (approximately CAD 31,000 to CAD 62,000 as of December 2022). This allowance helps Vives participants cover round-trip travel expenses as well as living expenses in their host country. Vives participants are also provided with accident and travel insurance for the duration of their internships. Vives participants are to return to Spain upon completion of their placement."
