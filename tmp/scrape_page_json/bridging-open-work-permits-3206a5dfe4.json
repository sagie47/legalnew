The factors provided for each code demonstrate how the situation may meet the requirements of R205(a). Officers must also always be satisfied that all requirements of section R200 are met.\n\nAdministrative code A75 is the code under which the work of certain foreign nationals, who are already working in Canada and are able to maintain their employment and settle while transitioning to permanent residence, may create significant economic or social benefits.\n\nAs such, the following foreign nationals do not qualify for a BOWP:\n\n* foreign nationals in Canada under[section R186](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html)who are exempt from the work permit requirement, except those under paragraph R186(u) \n * This cohort is not transitioning from a work permit to permanent residence.\n\n* foreign nationals applying for a BOWP at a port of entry or visa office (as they have not yet been authorized to enter as a temporary resident under[section A22](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-22.html)) \n * There is a significant benefit to applicants being physically in Canada and working while transitioning to permanent residence.\n\n* spouses and dependants of principal permanent residence applicants \n * This cohort of foreign nationals has access to work permits under different LMIA exemption categories.\n\n* foreign nationals who are inadmissible to Canada\n\nDocumentary evidence\n--------------------\n\nApplicants for a BOWP must provide the following:\n\n* a completed [Application to Change Conditions, Extend my Stay or Remain in Canada as a Worker form [IMM 5710 (PDF, 442 KB)]](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5710e.pdf)\n * The response to “What type of work permit are you applying for?” must be “Open Work Permit” to meet the eligibility requirements.\n\n* payment of the [work permit processing fee, the open work permit holder fee](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/immigration/work-permit-r196-r299-1.html) and, if applicable, the restoration fee\n* proof that they have met the APR stage corresponding to their permanent residence class and application submission, as stated in the [General eligibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/provincial-nominees-permanent-resident-applicants/bridging-open-work-permits.html#toc1) section \n * Applicants under the AFP, the caring for children class and the caring for people with high medical needs class are issued an approval in principle letter or eligibility letter upon receiving a positive eligibility assessment on their APR and must provide a copy of this letter with their open work permit application.\n * Applicants under the non-Express Entry PNP are not issued an approval-in-principle letter. The applicants are required to provide proof of the acknowledgement of receipt letter for their permanent residence application. The processing office will put the BOWP application on hold until stage 1 eligibility is passed, and then a BOWP application can be assessed.\n\nSpecific eligibility – Provincial nominees\n------------------------------------------\n\nForeign nationals in the Provincial Nominee Program(PNP) are eligible for a BOWP **only** if they\n\n* provided with their application a copy of the nomination letter issued by the nominating province or territory that **indicates their employment is unrestricted**\n* selected “Open Work Permit” on their application form\n\nFor certain employer-driven streams in the PNP, the nominating province or territory may impose employment restrictions on a successful nominee until the person becomes a permanent resident. **If employment restrictions are imposed, IRCC does not issue an open work permit to the foreign national under the BOWP LMIA exemption**. For provincial nominees with employment restrictions, see [Foreign workers nominated by a province or territory](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/federal-provincial-territorial-agreements-r204-lmia-exemption-code-t13.html) (LMIA exemption code T13).\n\nTo help officers determine if the applicant is subject to restrictions on employment, a nomination template letter has been provided to all provinces and territories. Provinces and territories have been instructed to choose “Yes” or “No” in the “Restrictions on employment” field, as this provides IRCC officers with confirmation of whether or not the nominee is, in fact, eligible to apply for a BOWP.\n\n### Template letter\n\n![Image 1](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/images/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/provincial-nominees-permanent-resident-applicants/nom-letter-2-fra.gif)\n\nText Version:\n\nNominee name Express entry profile number\nDate of birth Job seeker validation code\nNomination certificate #Prov./terr. stream\nDate application received by prov/terr Prov./terr. reference # (if applicable)\nDate nomination issued Employer (if applicable)\nDate nomination will expire Name of occupation and NOC\nOriginal nomination or extension Restrictions on employment\n\nProvinces and territories may include an employer or the name of the occupation and the National Occupational Classification (NOC) code **and still indicate that there are no employment restrictions.** In these cases, applicants are eligible for an open work permit, provided they meet the other eligibility criteria. A separate letter from the applicant or the nominating province to confirm that no employment restrictions exist should not be requested.\n\n### Employment location (mandatory imposition of condition)\n\nWhen a BOWP is being issued to an applicant for permanent residence under the PNP, the employment location on the work permit must be restricted to the nominating province. See [Specific conditions related to temporary work](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html#conditions)\n\nTherefore, in the Global Case Management System (GCMS), the “Province of Destination” must be the nominating province. The “City of Destination” is the name of the province followed by “NES” (not elsewhere stated) to allow for work anywhere in the nominating province.\n\nFor example:\n\n* **Province of Destination:** AB\n* **City of Destination:** Alberta NES\n\nSpecific eligibility – Agri-Food Pilot\n--------------------------------------\n\nBOWP applications for the Agri-Food Pilot (AFP) must be submitted online. Applicants **must provide** their approval in principle letter in the “Client Information” field with their online work permit application.\n\nSpecific eligibility – Quebec skilled workers and investors\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnder the terms of the [Canada–Quebec Accord](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/agreements/federal-provincial-territorial/quebec/canada-quebec-accord-relating-immigration-temporary-admission-aliens.html), Quebec is responsible for selecting applicants destined for the province of Quebec, and IRCC is responsible for determining admissibility. Those selected by the province are issued a Certificat de sélection du Québec (CSQ).\n\nApplicants in the Quebec skilled workers class or Quebec investors class are eligible for a BOWP after a completeness check (section R10). The CSQ must have been valid when the APR was submitted.\n\n### Employment location\n\nWhen a BOWP is being issued to an applicant for permanent residence under the QSWC, the employment location on the work permit must be restricted to the province of Quebec. See: [Specific conditions related to temporary work](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html#conditions)\n\nTherefore, in the GCMS, the “Province of Destination” must be “QC,” and the “City of Destination” must be entered as Quebec NES (not elsewhere stated), as in the following example:\n\n* **Province of Destination:** QC\n* **City of Destination:** Quebec NES\n\n### Work permit validity for the QSWC and the Quebec investor class\n\nThe Quebec investor class and the QSWC [processing times](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html) usually extend to 24 months or more. Therefore, to ensure that applicants do not have to submit multiple work permit extensions, the duration for the initial BOWP is 24 months or passport validity, whichever is shorter.\n\nExtensions, if needed, should be issued for 12 months.\n\nHowever, officers may use their discretion case by case, depending on current [processing times](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/check-processing-times.html) for permanent residence applications.\n\nSpecific eligibility – Home Child Care Provider Pilot (HCCPP) or Home Support Worker Pilot (HSWP)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nForeign nationals in the HCCPP or HSWP are eligible for a BOWP if they have received a positive eligibility decision (approval in principle) on their application for permanent residence after completing their qualifying work experience.\n\nUnder the ministerial instructions dated June 18, 2019, applicants in the HCCPP or the HSWP had to complete 24 months of qualifying work experience. On April 30, 2023, the 24 months of experience was reduced to 12 months of qualifying experience. On June 16, 2024, the 12 months of qualifying work experience requirement was reduced to 6 months, and experience for the Gaining experience category can now be gained both within and outside Canada. This change applies to all applications, including pending applications.\n\nThe application should be submitted online unless the applicant is exempt from the requirement to submit an in-Canada application online under section R9.4 or R9.5.\n\nHow pilot applicants provide proof of their work experience depends on their category:\n\n* Gaining experience category (Category A): \n * Applicants complete 6 months of qualifying experience, after being approved for an occupation-restricted work permit (or, in certain cases, before obtaining approval), then submit[Schedule 19b – Home Child Care Provider or Home Support Worker – Work Experience [IMM 5910] (PDF, 150 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm5910e.pdf)with evidence of qualifying work experience.\n\n* Direct to permanent residence category (Category B): \n * Applicants submit[Schedule 19b – Home Child Care Provider or Home Support Worker – Work Experience [IMM 5910] (PDF, 150KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm5910e.pdf)and evidence of work experience with their permanent residence application.\n\nA BOWP can be issued to\n\n* eligible Category A applicants who have passed Stage 2 eligibility, including Category A applicants whose experience has been assessed as eligible before an OROWP was approved \n * In this case, rather than the client applying specifically for a BOWP, the officer would convert the pending OROWP application to a BOWP application if the client is eligible for one. \n\n* eligible Category B applicants who have passed eligibility on their application for permanent residence \n\nAdditional processing information can be found under Home Child Care Provider and Home Support Worker Pilot: Making a final decision – Proof of work experience received before OROWP approval.\n\nThe following special program code should be used:\n\n* CARE4411 (Caregivers – HCCP Pilot)\n* CARE4412 (Caregivers – HSW Pilot)\n\nApplication assessment\n----------------------\n\nWork permit applications are processed based on the information provided by the foreign national. If the foreign national has indicated on their work permit application that they are applying for an open work permit, officers must ensure that the applicant meets the eligibility requirements, regardless of whether an employer’s name is mentioned in the application.\n\nIf it is clear that complex or contentious issues or concerns exist on the APR (for example, the APR is approved in principle, but further investigation on the client is required), the work permit application should be referred to a local office for additional review. Once satisfied that any complex or contentious issues have been resolved, the local office can issue the work permit following these same instructions.\n\n**Important:** Officers should ensure that both general and specific eligibility are met.\n\n### Permanent residence application stage\n\n#### Express Entry or QSWC: Completeness check\n\nIf a foreign national submits an e-APR using Express Entry or submits an application under the QSWC, they may apply for an open work permit using this administrative LMIA exemption code once they meet the [General eligibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/provincial-nominees-permanent-resident-applicants/bridging-open-work-permits.html#toc1) criteria.\n\nA BOWP can only be issued if the e-APR or QSWC application has passed the [section R10](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-10.html) completeness check. As such, Express Entry applicants or QSWC applicants should submit their acknowledgement of receipt with their BOWP application.\n\nBefore issuing a BOWP, officers **must** check the GCMS to ensure that the Centralized Intake Office (CIO) has reviewed the application and determined that it meets the requirements of a complete application as described in sections R10 and R12.01.\n\nIf the e-APR or QSWC APR is incomplete, the application for a BOWP must be refused.

The factors provided for each code demonstrate how the situation may meet the requirements of R205(a).

The applicants are required to provide proof of the acknowledgement of receipt letter for their permanent residence application.

For provincial nominees with employment restrictions, see [Foreign workers nominated by a province or territory](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/federal-provincial-territorial-agreements-r204-lmia-exemption-code-t13.html) (LMIA exemption code T13).\n\nTo help officers determine if the applicant is subject to restrictions on employment, a nomination template letter has been provided to all provinces and territories. Provinces and territories have been instructed to choose “Yes” or “No” in the “Restrictions on employment” field, as this provides IRCC officers with confirmation of whether or not the nominee is, in fact, eligible to apply for a BOWP."

This change applies to all applications, including pending applications.\n\nThe application should be submitted online unless the applicant is exempt from the requirement to submit an in-Canada application online under section R9.4 or R9.5.\n\nHow pilot applicants provide proof of their work experience depends on their category:\n\n* Gaining experience category (Category A): \n * Applicants complete 6 months of qualifying experience, after being approved for an occupation-restricted work permit (or, in certain cases, before obtaining approval), then submit[Schedule 19b – Home Child Care Provider or Home Support Worker – Work Experience [IMM 5910] (PDF, 150 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm5910e.pdf)with evidence of qualifying work experience.\n\n* Direct to permanent residence category (Category B): \n * Applicants submit[Schedule 19b – Home Child Care Provider or Home Support Worker – Work Experience [IMM 5910] (PDF, 150KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/kits/forms/imm5910e.pdf)and evidence of work experience with their permanent residence application.\n\nA BOWP can be issued to\n\n* eligible Category A applicants who have passed Stage 2 eligibility, including Category A applicants whose experience has been assessed as eligible before an OROWP was approved \n * In this case, rather than the client applying specifically for a BOWP, the officer would convert the pending OROWP application to a BOWP application if the client is eligible for one. \n\n* eligible Category B applicants who have passed eligibility on their application for permanent residence \n\nAdditional processing information can be found under Home Child Care Provider and Home Support Worker Pilot: Making a final decision – Proof of work experience received before OROWP approval.\n\nThe following special program code should be used:\n\n* CARE4411 (Caregivers – HCCP Pilot)\n* CARE4412 (Caregivers – HSW Pilot)\n\nApplication assessment\n----------------------\n\nWork permit applications are processed based on the information provided by the foreign national. If the foreign national has indicated on their work permit application that they are applying for an open work permit, officers must ensure that the applicant meets the eligibility requirements, regardless of whether an employer’s name is mentioned in the application.\n\nIf it is clear that complex or contentious issues or concerns exist on the APR (for example, the APR is approved in principle, but further investigation on the client is required), the work permit application should be referred to a local office for additional review. Once satisfied that any complex or contentious issues have been resolved, the local office can issue the work permit following these same instructions.\n\n**Important:** Officers should ensure that both general and specific eligibility are met."
