It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nInterviews\n----------\n\nAn officer may interview the client as part of the enforcement, selection or counselling process. Interviews provide officers with information regarding possible inadmissibility and violations of the Act. An officer may also use interviews to assess credibility, confirm facts related to need and/or risk and communicate concerns to the client.\n\nWhen an interview is necessary\n------------------------------\n\n* where a permit is being considered for serious inadmissibility or flagrant or intentional violations \n* where a permit is being considered for a determined or suspected victim of human trafficking\n* to assess credibility, merit, or risk and the degree of contrition\n* where consideration of the TRP is due to the person being a possible victim of human trafficking.\n\n**Note:** Under the [Victims of Human Trafficking program page](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/permits/considerations-specific-victims-human-trafficking.html) there are interview guidelines specific to victims of trafficking. Otherwise, general [policies and procedures to conduct interviews](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/interview.html) are available.\n\nWhen an interview may not be necessary\n--------------------------------------\n\n* the inadmissibility is on grounds of health or non-compliance, and\n* when credibility or merit is not an issue.\n\nThird-party information\n-----------------------\n\nOfficers must weigh the merits of each case in relation to the seriousness of the inadmissibility or violation. If it is necessary to obtain information or confirmation from third parties, documentary evidence should be kept on file.\n\n To ensure [procedural fairness (PDF, 597.29 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/resources/manuals/op/op01-eng.pdf), if officers use third-party information to arrive at a decision, the client must be informed and allowed to respond, if the information is not classified. This may include internal reports or recommendations relied on by the decision maker but only if disclosure is necessary to provide the client with a reasonable opportunity, under the circumstances, to participate meaningfully in the decision making process.\n\nDisclosure of information\n-------------------------\n\nA recommendation prepared for the decision maker, based on information already known to the client, by an officer who does not possess any specialized expertise or knowledge that the decision maker does not also have, does not need to be disclosed.\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2017-10-16",
