If the applicant leaves Canada after they applied, they can still be eligible under the public policy.\n\n**Had a work permit at some point during that period**\n\n* Applicants must have a copy of an expired work permit. If the proof cannot be provided by the applicant, officers may check in GCMS if the applicant was issued a work permit during that period.\n\n**Status in Canada**\n\nApplicants must\n\n* not have authorization to work and \n * have no legal immigration status; or \n * be a visitor \n\n* not have made a refugee claim in Canada \n* not be subject to a removal order \n\n**Proof:** Officers may verify this in GCMS\n\n### Family members in Canada\n\nAccompanying family members must provide the following:\n\n* A copy of the IMM 0008 form for the PR application in which the principal applicant listed the name of their family members. \n* Proof of relationship (for example, a marriage certificate, Statutory Declaration of Common-Law Union [IMM 5409], birth certificate of a common child that shows both parents’ names)\n* If the family members are applying individually after the principal applicant receives approval from IRCC on their TR application(s) to be authorized to work or to stay in Canada as a visitor, the family members are instructed to include a letter in their application indicating: \n * the principal applicant’s work permit number (W#) or the visitor record number issued by IRCC and/or the principal applicant’s PR application number \n * they are applying under this public policy: [Temporary public policy to exempt home care workers who have made an application for a permanent resident visa through the Home Care Worker Immigration pilots from certain temporary residence requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/wp-out-of-status-home-care-workers.html)\n\n* If the family members are applying with the principal applicant as a family group, they are not required to include this letter in their application. \n\n**Be physically present in Canada**\n\nThe officer needs to be satisfied that the applicant was physically present in Canada when they submitted any application facilitated under this public policy. If the applicant leaves Canada after they applied, they can still be eligible under the public policy.\n\n**Status in Canada**\n\nTo be eligible for this public policy, applicants must\n\n* not have made a refugee claim in Canada \n* not be subject to a removal order \n\n**Proof:** This requirement should be verified by the officer in GCMS\n\nReceipt of application\n----------------------\n\nAll applications must be submitted online unless the applicant is exempt under section [R9.4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/page-2.html#h-1137913) or [R9.5](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/page-2.html#h-1137913).\n\n**Paper application**\n\nIf the applicant meets one of the exemptions under section [R9.4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-9.4.html) or [R9.5](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-9.5.html) (for example, if they require accommodations under section R9.5, including for a disability), they can submit their application in another format (paper, braille or large print) after meeting the requirement of a complete PR application as per[section R10](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-10.html).\n\nAssessing the application\n-------------------------\n\nProcessing officers must ensure that the requirements for the application are met.\n\n### Assessing if the applicant passed the R10 completeness check on their application for permanent residence\n\nIf the officer is satisfied that the TR application met all eligibility requirements except for the requirement that the PR application has passed the R10 completeness check, the officer **must put the TR application on hold** and check regularly in GCMS to see if the AOR is issued. **The officer should not refuse an application until a decision is made on section R10.**\n\n* If the PR application met the requirement of section R10 and has been placed into processing, the officer **may continue processing** the TR application(s).\n* If the PR application did not meet the requirement of section R10, the TR application(s) **should be refused** for not meeting the requirement of the [temporary public policy](https://canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/wp-out-of-status-home-care-workers.html).\n* If no PR application is submitted, the TR application should be refused. \n\n### Genuine relationship\n\nAs per[section R4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-4.html), a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse or a common-law partner of a person if the marriage or common-law partnership\n\n* was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),**or**\n* is not genuine.\n\nIf officers have concerns as to the genuineness of the relationship between the principal applicant and their spouse or common-law partner, they may request further documentation or information to confirm that the relationship between the dependent spouse or common-law partner and the principal foreign national is genuine and is not a relationship of convenience.\n\n### Dependent children and working age\n\nThere is no set minimum age to be eligible for a work permit. The submission of work permit applications on behalf of minor children is at the discretion of their parent(s) or authorized guardian(s).\n\nThe “working age” varies across provincial and territorial jurisdictions and there is no minimum age specified in the IRPR or the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) for issuing a work permit.\n\nTherefore, unless there are reasonable grounds for an officer to be satisfied that a dependent child is unable to perform the work sought or any other reasons for refusal, minors may be issued a work permit.\n\nPlease refer to the instructions on[Who qualifies as a dependent child](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/non-economic-classes/dependent-children.html#assessing_dependent_children)to confirm if an applicant meets the definition of a dependent child in relation to the principal applicant.\n\n### Renewals\n\n**Renewals – Principal foreign nationals**\n\nPrincipal applicants who have a PR application in process that has not been withdrawn or refused, and who, under the public policy, were granted one of the following:\n\n* extension of temporary resident status, under subsection [R181(1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/page-24.html#h-688400); or\n* restoration of temporary resident status, under subsection [R182(1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/page-24.html#h-688408),\n\nare eligible to extend their temporary status in Canada for up to an additional 3 years under this public policy.
