It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nThese instructions apply to IRCC employees. Given that applicants can’t submit their applications at a port of entry, the instructions don’t apply to border services officers.\n\nThe instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with the following:\n\n* [Open work permit – General processing and issuance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html)\n* [Conditions and validity period on work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html)\n* [Assessing the application against selection criteria](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/assessing-application-selection-criteria.html)\n\nIRCC uses specific administrative codes to identify certain situations where it considers that the work of a foreign national creates [significant social, cultural or economic benefits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/canadian-interests-significant-benefit-general-guidelines-r205-c10.html#s3) or opportunities for Canadian citizens or permanent residents, as described in paragraph 205(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR). The factors provided for each code demonstrate how the situation may meet the requirements of paragraph R205(a). Officers must also always be satisfied that the situation meets all requirements of sections [R200](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html) and [R201](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-201.html) (if they are applying to renew their work authorization).\n\nAdministrative code C90 is the code under which the work of certain foreign nationals in the specific National Occupational Classifications (NOCs) plays an important role in supporting Canadian families. As foreign nationals in transition to permanent residence, applicants under these pilots may create significant economic or social benefits.\n\nThere are [2 categories](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/occupation-restricted-open-work.html#s1) of permanent resident applicants under the pilots:\n\n* Gaining experience category ([Category A](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/terms-definitions-related-permanent-residence.html#cata))\n* Direct to permanent residence category ([Category B](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/terms-definitions-related-permanent-residence.html#catb))\n\nApplicants who belong to Category A must submit their work permit application with their permanent residence application online, and the requirements for permanent residence are assessed first. If applicants have less than 6 months of eligible work experience but meet all other requirements, they should be issued an occupation-restricted open work permit (OROWP) that will give them time to obtain the eligible work experience. In some cases, an OROWP could also be issued [after the applicant has already gained the experience](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/occupation-restricted-open-work.html#proof-before-OROWP).\n\nApplicants who belong to the Direct to permanent residence category (Category B) (and those from Category A who have now met the work experience requirement ) may be eligible for a bridging open work permit ([BOWP](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/provincial-nominees-permanent-resident-applicants/bridging-open-work-permits.html)

categories\n--------------------\n\nApplicants under the pilots are divided into 2 categories, depending on whether they have the eligible work experience:\n\n* The Gaining experience category ([Category A](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/terms-definitions-related-permanent-residence.html#cata)) is defined as a group of applicants (outside or within Canada) who have less than the required eligible work experience at the time of application submission.\n* The Direct to permanent residence category ([Category B](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/terms-definitions-related-permanent-residence.html#catb)) is defined as a group of applicants (outside or within Canada) who have already completed the required Canadian work experience in the following occupations on the date the permanent residence application under 1 of the pilots is made: \n * for applications assessed as per NOC 2016, either NOC 4411 or NOC 4412\n * for applications assessed as per NOC 2021, either NOC 44100 or NOC 44101\n\n* Combined work experience under the 2 NOCs is not counted. \n * Category B applicants are not eligible for an OROWP. However, they could be eligible to apply for a[BOWP](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/provincial-nominees-permanent-resident-applicants/bridging-open-work-permits.html)after receiving a positive eligibility decision on their application for permanent residence.\n\n**Important:** In some cases, the Category A applicant obtains the qualifying work experience **before** being issued an OROWP under this administrative code. Depending on the situation, officers may be required to issue an OROWP or a BOWP, or cancel the work permit application and issue the Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR). The officers are required to follow the process outlined in [Home Child Care Provider and Home Support Worker Pilot: Making a final decision – Proof of work experience received before OROWP approval](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/final-decision.html#proof-before-OROWP) and summarized below.\n\nIf the applicant is **in Canada**, and the permanent residence application passed eligibility, assess the work permit application under the [BOWP](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/provincial-nominees-permanent-resident-applicants/bridging-open-work-permits.html)guidance.\n\nIf the applicant is **overseas** or is**in Canada but not eligible for a BOWP,**proceed with the appropriate option below after the applicant has passed both the eligibility and the admissibility:\n\n* If the COPR**cannot** be issued at the moment, issue the work permit under the OROWP – C90 guidance. \n* If the COPR **can** be issued at the moment but the client is **in Canada**, issue the work permit under the OROWP – C90 guidance, **and** issue the COPR. (The applicant must be able to maintain valid temporary resident status.)\n* If the COPR **can** be issued and the client is **overseas**, cancel the work permit application, refund both the work permit processing fee and the open work permit holder fee, then issue the COPR.\n\nEligibility\n-----------\n\nTo be eligible for an OROWP under one of the pilots, the applicant must\n\n* apply for the OROWP **together with** their application for permanent residence\n* meet the [eligibility requirements under the HCCPP or HSWP](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/assessing-application-selection-criteria.html)*\n* have an eligible [job offer and be likely to accept it](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/assessing-application-selection-criteria.html#job-offer)*\n* be [able to perform the work](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/assessing-application-selection-criteria.html#ability) described in the lead statement of the occupational description of the NOC\n* have paid the work permit processing fee ($155) and the open work permit holder fee ($100)\n\n*[Special exemptions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/final-decision.html#proof-before-OROWP) may apply to applicants who provide proof of Canadian work experience before OROWP approval.\n\nOfficers may consult the [HCCPP and HSWP instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots.html) for guidance on permanent residence eligibility criteria, intake and processing.\n\n**Note:** Due to the requirement to submit the work permit with the permanent resident application, Gaining experience (Category A) applicants can’t submit their work permit application upon entry to Canada at the port of entry.\n\nReceipt of work permit applications\n-----------------------------------\n\nWork permit applications must be submitted online with applications for permanent residence through the Permanent Residence Portal.\n\nFor pilot application packages submitted via the Permanent Residence Portal, officers will find the work permit application listed as **Other** in the list of documents in the portal.\n\nFor pilot application packages submitted in an alternate format through regular mail, officers should find the correct paper version of the work permit application included with the permanent residence application and supporting documents.\n\nRegardless of the method of receipt, after the completed permanent residence application is created and promoted, the officer will\n\n* create the prospective work permit application in the Global Case Management System (GCMS)\n* promote the work permit application once all required data entry is complete\n\n### Application forms\n\nFor applicants who are physically outside of Canada, the [Application for a work permit made outside of Canada [IMM 1295] (PDF, 572 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm1295e.pdf) should be received, with the appropriate fees: $155 for the work permit fee and $100 for the open work permit holder fee.\n\nFor applicants who are physically in Canada and **are authorized** to apply for a work permit after entry as per [section R199](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-199.html), the [Application to change conditions, extend my stay or remain in Canada as a worker [IMM 5710] (PDF, 587 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5710e.pdf) should be received, with the appropriate fees: $155 for the work permit fee and $100 for the open work permit holder fee.\n\nFor applicants who are physically in Canada but **are not authorized** to apply after entry, the [Application for a work permit made outside of Canada [IMM 1295] (PDF, 572 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm1295e.pdf) should be received, with the appropriate fees: $155 for the work permit fee and $100 for the open work permit holder fee. There is also a [special measure process](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/occupation-restricted-open-work.html#s9) for applicants who have an existing valid work permit in Canada, but had originally applied with the outside-Canada form.\n\n**Important:** All applicants are required to maintain their status and authorizations if in Canada. They may need to apply for an extension of their temporary resident status separately to ensure they do not fall out of status while awaiting a decision on their application for permanent residence under the caregiver pilots.\n\nApplication assessment\n----------------------\n\nUnder the pilots, the permanent residence requirements are assessed before the work permit application.\n\n### Permanent residence application is eligible\n\nIf the officer is satisfied that the applicant meets the[eligibility requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/occupation-restricted-open-work.html#s2)for permanent residence under the Gaining experience category and is[admissible](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/admissibility.html), the officer will process the OROWP application.\n\n### Permanent residence application is refused\n\nIf the application for permanent residence is refused (a stage-1 negative decision), the processing officer must follow the steps below for the work permit application created in GCMS:\n\nWhere the**IMM 1295**(outside-Canada form) was submitted, the officer must\n\n* cancel the work permit application (because there is no “reject” choice in GCMS) \n * Enter the “App Status Reason” as “Other”.\n * Enter the “Other Reason Description” as “Rejection MI52”.\n\n* refund the work permit processing fee and open work permit holder fee\n\nWhere the IMM 5710 (inside-Canada form) was submitted, the officer must\n\n* assess and make a final decision on the work permit application \n * This assessment will most likely be a refusal because the eligibility criteria under administrative code C90 are not met.\n\n* refund the open work permit fee\n\n**Important:**Applications for a work permit and extension of status in Canada (inside-Canada application form) should not be cancelled or rejected, as that affects the applicant’s maintained status and authority to work without a permit.\n\n**Note:** For negative decisions on the work permit application, the same procedure applies to accompanying family members who submitted an application for a work permit, study permit, TRV or visitor record extension with the application for permanent residence. For example, if the principal applicant is in Canada and the accompanying family members are overseas, the officer will refuse the work permit application for the principal applicant, and cancel and refund all overseas temporary residence applications.\n\n### Applicant is inadmissible or non-compliant\n\nIf it is determined that a Gaining experience category applicant is in Canada and has lost their status or been determined inadmissible, the officer should follow the [instructions for assessing the permanent residence application](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/admissibility.html) first.\n\nIf the officer passes the permanent residence admissibility based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations (H&C) under [A25(1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-2.5/section-25.1.html), they must determine if issuing a temporary resident permit (TRP) is warranted to overcome any non-compliance or inadmissibility and allow the applicant to regain their temporary resident status.\n\nIf the TRP is issued, the OROWP may be issued for the same length of time as the TRP. However, the work permit is issued under [paragraph R207(d)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-207.html), because the applicant has applied for permanent residence and the Minister granted them an exemption on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. The permanent residence application remains in the pilot.\n\nSince the applicant is still part of the permanent resident pilot, the work permit should be issued as occupation-restricted, but the following administrative code is used: **A70**.\n\nAll other coding remains the same.\n\n### Applicant has an existing valid work permit\n\nWhen assessing the outside-Canada work permit application [IMM 1295] (work permit category in GCMS) for the OROWP, if the processing officer determines that the applicant has received a work permit under a different category, the officer must confirm that the applicant is still interested in being processed under the pilots.\n\nThe special measure process should be followed if, **at the time of decision** on the OROWP application, the applicant\n\n* holds a valid work permit in any other category (for example, post-graduation work permit, Canada–Ukraine authorization for emergency travel [CUAET], labour market impact assessment [LMIA]-based)\n* was physically outside Canada at the time of their initial work permit application under the pilot, but has subsequently entered Canada\n* has passed eligibility and admissibility (Stage 1) for HCCPP / HSWP Gaining experience (Category A)\n\nThis special measure applies only to unfinalized work permit applications where clients have an existing authorization to work; therefore, it does **not** apply to applicants who are physically in Canada and are in the following situation:\n\n* The OROWP was approved, and the letter of introduction sent.\n* The applicant entered Canada as a visitor with no authority to work.\n\n#### Special measure process\n\n#### No final decision made\n\nIf, at the time of the decision on the work permit application, an integrated search indicates that the applicant is presently in Canada and holds a work permit, the processing officer must\n\n* pass eligibility on the work permit application\n* if applicable, uncheck the TRV option in GCMS to remove the counterfoil requirement\n* send a request letter based on the [template (PDF, 744 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/corporate/publications-manuals/cpc-request-letter-for-tr-workaround-eng.pdf) with the Client Information paragraph to allow for the uploading of the response\n* enter the final decision on the work permit application when the response is received or the time to submit has passed. \n * If approved, follow the steps to print in Canada\n\n#### Final decision was completed and official passport request letter has been sent\n\nIf the work permit application was finalized and a draft work permit and counterfoil exist, but the applicant entered Canada on a work permit under a different category, and the OROWP application status is “Open”, the following steps should be taken to implement the special measure:\n\n1. Ensure that the “Position” is set to “Migration Office and Visa Officer Responsibility”.\n2. Cancel the existing draft control document activity under the “Finalize Application View” tab.\n3. Change the “Application Status” to “Re-open” in the “History View” tab.\n4. Delete the final decision of “Approved”. \n * If applicable, uncheck “Counterfoil req” in GCMS to remove the counterfoil requirement.\n\n5. Send a request letter based on the template (available internally only) with the “Client Information” paragraph to allow for the uploading of the response.\n\n**Once the officer receives an email response from the client that they wish to proceed with the permanent residence and the required info is provided.**\n\n**On the “Application” screen:**\n\n1. **Primary or Secondary Office:** The Case Processing Centre (CPC) has to be one of these or the document will **not** print out.\n2. Under **Clients & Parties tab – Client Details**, ensure that the **mailing and residential** addresses have been updated and are showing up in the Address fields in the application in GCMS.\n3. Re-enter “FIN DEC” as “Approved” to generate a new work permit activity line in the **Finalize Application** tab. Under the **Finalize Application** tab, make or confirm the changes to the work permit document below.\n\nIn the sub-applet on the work permit document:\n\n1. Confirm that the **Address** fields show the correct Canadian address. \n2. **Conditions** should be added: Not authorized to work in any other occupation.\n3. **User Remarks:** May not engage in employment in the province of Quebec.\n\nIn the Document activity line:\n\n1. **Valid to:** 3 years from the date finalized or untill passport expiry, whichever comes first.\n2. **Print Queue:** Add PQ-DOC-9518-8 to the specific document line.\n3. **Status:** Set to “Authorized”.\n\n**Change the GCMS position**from the migration office to the IRCC letter of introduction at port of entry and navigate back to the application. Change the status of the work permit document activity from “Authorized” to “Generate”.\n\n**Printing and mailing the work permit**\n\nThe print queue **PQ-DOC-9518-8** belongs to the Case Processing Centre in Edmonton (CPC-E).\n\nThe work permit will print with all other issued permits.\n\nThe CPC-E will change the status of the permit as required for normal processing after they have printed it, and will mail it to the applicant as per the standard mailing process.\n\nFinal decision\n--------------\n\n### Approval\n\nOn the \"Application screen\", officers should confirm or enter the following information in the specified fields:\n\n| Field | Selection or input |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case type | 20 |\n| Special program code | **Note:** A [workaround](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/occupation-restricted-open-work.html#workaround-duration) is required to ensure the right work permit duration.

If the initial work permit was issued **for less than 3 years** to align with the passport validity, an extension may be issued for the remaining eligibility period. To align with permanent residence objectives under the HCCPP and HSWP, the extension must not exceed 3 years from the date the initial work permit was issued under the pilot. |\n| Conditions **(mandatory)** | Not authorized to work in any other occupation Officers must include the following condition in the User remarks: * May not engage in employment in the province of Quebec . * Ne peut pas occuper un emploi dans la province de Québec. * (Refer to [Bilingual Remarks/Observations for Visitor Records, Work Permits and Study Permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/bilingual-remarks-observations.html).) |\n| User remarks **(mandatory)** | For work permits approved outside Canada: * Port of entry: Issue for 3 years from date of entry or until passport expiry, whichever is earlier. |\n\n### GCMS workaround to ensure the right work permit duration\n\nWhen IRCC or Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers are issuing a C90 work permit with the special program code “CARE4411” or “CARE4412”, the work permit is inadvertently issued to passport expiry when selecting “Generate” by default. Also, the “Valid to” date cannot be modified unless the special program code is removed.\n\nIRCC officers are asked to follow these steps when processing a C90 work permit until a system change is implemented in GCMS:\n\n1. Remove the special program code “CARE4411” or “CARE4412” prior to entering the final decision.\n2. Enter the final decision of “Approved” on the application. The permit should populate at “Not Started” under the “Finalize Application” tab.\n3. Enter the conditions and validity date of the permit as the **earliest** of the following: \n * **the current date plus 3 years, or**\n * **the expiry date of the travel document associated with the application**\n\n4. Change the permit status from “Not Started” to “Generate.”\n5. Add the special program code back to the application.\n\nCBSA officers are asked to follow these steps:\n\n1. Set the “Status of permit” to “Cancelled”.\n2. Proceed to the “History” tab and “App Status” = “Re-Issue” and “App Status Reason” = “Correction at port of entry”.\n3. Remove the special program code “CARE4411” or “CARE4412”.\n4. Proceed to the “Finalize Application” tab and click on the “New” blue button.\n5. Enter the conditions and validity date of the permit as the **earliest** of the following: \n * **the current date plus 3 years, or**\n * **the expiry date of the travel document associated to the application**\n\n6. Change the permit status from “Not Started” to “Generate.”\n7. Click the “Print” button, add the special program code and “Confirm.”\n\n### Refusals\n\nIf an officer has determined that the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements, they should record their reasons for the decision as per the instructions in: [Decision-making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html).\n\nIf the applicant is otherwise eligible and admissible but does not respond to requests for additional supporting documentation regarding the work permit application, the work permit application can be refused as per section A16 for non-compliance with the request.\n\nIf the permanent residence application is refused, the application for a work permit may be refused if the applicant is in Canada as per the [above instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/occupation-restricted-open-work.html#s7), as there is no longer the significant benefit of allowing early entry to Canada to obtain the work experience needed to obtain permanent residence. In GCMS, officers should choose the refusal ground “Other” and enter a summary of the decision in the comments (for example, “I am not satisfied that your work will be a significant benefit to Canada, as you will not be able to transition to permanent residence”). For more instructions on making a final decision for applications made outside or within Canada, consult [Home Child Care Provider and Home Support Worker Pilot: Making a final decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/final-decision.html).\n\nFamily members of Gaining experience applicants [R205(a) – C91]\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAccompanying family members are eligible for an open work permit. The work permit is issued under the authority of [paragraph R205(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-205.html).\n\nTo track the family members of the Gaining experience category applicants, the administrative code C91 should be used.\n\n### Dependent children and working age\n\nThere is no set minimum age to be eligible for a work permit. The submission of work permit applications on behalf of minor children is at the discretion of their parent(s) or authorized guardian(s).\n\nThe “working age” varies across provincial and territorial jurisdictions and there is no minimum age for work permit issuance specified in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) or the IRPR.\n\nAs such, unless there are reasonable grounds for an officer to be satisfied that a dependent child is unable to perform the work sought or any other reasons for refusal, minors may be issued a work permit.\n\nIRCC and CBSA officers **are not required** to assess the minimum age requirements in the province of destination for dependent children. Therefore, the onus is on the Canadian employers to meet the requirements of the labour laws of the province of destination.\n\nRefer to the [instructions on who qualifies as a dependent child](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/non-economic-classes/dependent-children.html#assessing_dependent_children) to confirm if an applicant meets the definition of a dependent child in relation to the principal applicant.\n\nThe child must meet the definition of dependent child when the work permit application is received **and** at time of decision.\n\nTemporary residence applications for family members\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nOfficers must confirm that the family member is included as accompanying in the application for permanent residence before finalizing any temporary residence applications.\n\nDependants may submit their temporary residence application together with the principal applicant’s application for permanent residence.\n\n**Important:** If the permanent residence application is submitted through the Permanent Residence Portal, once submission is complete, no additional applications or documentation can be added through the portal.\n\n**Note:** In the Permanent Residence Portal, temporary residence applications for the principal applicant and for dependants are both submitted by\n\n* uploading all their temporary residence forms under **Additional Supporting Documents**\n* choosing document type **Other**\n\nDependants who did not include their temporary residence application in the same package as the caregiver application for permanent residence can only submit their application after the caregiver (principal applicant) receives an acknowledgement of receipt letter confirming that the permanent residence application has been put into processing.\n\n**Important:** Real permanent residence application numbers start with an E. A confirmation of submission, which uses a temporary application number that starts with an X, or an automated email notification sent when an application is submitted in the Permanent Residence Portal is not sufficient proof of approval in principle for issuing a work permit to a dependant.\n\nIn such cases, dependants must upload proof of the principal applicant’s acknowledgement of receipt letter in the “Client Information” field when they apply online through the IRCC secure account (MyAccount).\n\nIf migration offices receive an online application from dependants overseas and the OROWP **has not yet been issued** for the caregiver’s application for permanent residence, the migration office should\n\n* enter the special program codes CARE4411 or CARE4412\n* transfer the application to the office handling the application for permanent residence (the primary office)\n* add this note in GCMS: \n * Principal applicant’s caregiver permanent residence application is pending stage 1 approval. Transferred to the office processing the application for permanent residence for processing and final decision.\n\nUpon review of the temporary residence application, the CPC-E or local office will put the application on hold until eligibility and admissibility are met (and the principal applicant’s OROWP is issued).\n\nIf the dependants are eligible to apply for temporary residence after entry and they used the in-Canada form, the CPC-E or local office will process the application and make the final decision as per the regular procedure.\n\nIf migration offices receive an online application from dependants overseas and the CPC-E has **already issued** a positive stage 1 approval letter and an OROWP to the caregiver applicant, the appropriate migration office can make a final decision on the temporary residence application.\n\n### Study permits\n\nThe instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with [Temporary Residents: Students](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits.html).\n\n#### Minor children\n\n[Minor children](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/guidelines-on-minor-children.html) already in Canada are authorized under [subsection 30(2) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-30.html) to study without a study permit at the preschool, primary or secondary level if one of their parents (biological or adoptive) is authorized to work or study in Canada. This includes temporary residents who are\n\n* work permit holders\n* study permit holders\n* visitor status holders (for example, visitor record holders) who are either authorized to work without a permit, as per[section R186](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html), or authorized to study without a permit, as per[section R188](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-188.html)\n\n#### Validity period of the study permit\n\nThe study permit is valid until the expiry date of the caregiver’s work permit or the passport or travel document, whichever is earlier.\n\n#### Special program code\n\nFor accompanying spouses or common-law partners and dependants who are issued a study permit, officers must indicate the special program code “CARE4411” (Caregivers&fam-HCCP Pilot) or “CARE4412” (Caregivers&fam-HSW Pilot) under which the caregiver is applying.\n\n### Temporary resident visa (TRV) or electronic travel authorization (eTA)\n\nPreschool-age dependants need to apply for either a TRV or an electronic travel authorization (eTA). At the port of entry, the preschool-age dependant should be authorized to enter for the same duration as the principal applicant’s OROWP or until the expiry date of the passport or travel document, whichever is earlier.\n\n#### Special program code for visitors\n\nFor accompanying spouses or common-law partners and dependants who are issued either a TRV or a visitor record, officers must indicate the special program code “CARE4411” (Caregivers&fam-HCCP Pilot) or “CARE4412” (Caregivers&fam-HSW Pilot) under which the caregiver is applying.\n\nScenarios\n---------\n\nWhile it is preferred that any work permit or study permit applications for dependants be included in the principal applicant’s permanent residence application, there are cases where dependants may choose to submit their work or study permit applications together as a family group or later in the process. Below are 3 such scenarios.\n\n### Principal applicant and dependants are overseas\n\n#### Principal applicant\n\n* The principal applicant submits an application for permanent residence and a work permit application using the [Application for work permit made outside of Canada [IMM 1295] (PDF, 572 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm1295e.pdf).\n* If the eligibility criteria (except the work experience) are met and the applicant and family members are not inadmissible, the following happens: \n * A decision letter (letter of introduction) is issued.\n * Once the principal applicant arrives at the port of entry, an OROWP may be issued. \n * The length of the work permit is aligned with the permanent residence window (3 years or until the passport expires, whichever is first).\n\n#### Dependants\n\n* Dependants may be eligible to apply for an open work permit (LMIA exemption code C91).\n* Unless exempt, they may require and be eligible for a study permit. \n * For instructions regarding study permit eligibility or exemptions, consult [Temporary Residents: Students](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits.html).\n\n* Unless exempt, they may require or be eligible for a TRV \n * For instructions regarding TRV requirements or exemptions, consult: [Temporary resident visas](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/what-visa.html).\n\n* They must use the appropriate work permit, study permit or TRV application form for applicants outside Canada. They may include it with the application for permanent residence or as a separate temporary residence application upon receipt of the acknowledgement of receipt (with an application number starting with an E).\n\n### Principal applicant is in Canada and dependants are overseas\n\n#### Principal applicant\n\n* The principal applicant submits an application for permanent residence and a work permit application using the [Application to change conditions, extend my stay or remain in Canada as a worker [IMM 5710](PDF, 587 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/pdf/kits/forms/imm5710e.pdf) form.\n* The principal applicant is eligible to apply for a work permit after entry under section R199. \n * If the eligibility criteria (except the work experience) are met and the applicant and family members are not inadmissible, an OROWP should be issued.\n\n#### Dependants\n\n* Dependants may be eligible to apply for an open work permit (LMIA exemption code C91).\n* Unless exempt, they may require and be eligible for a study permit. \n * For instructions regarding study permit eligibility or exemptions, consult [Temporary Residents: Students](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits.html).\n\n* Unless exempt, they may require or be eligible for a TRV. \n * For instructions regarding TRV requirements or exemptions, consult: [Temporary resident visas](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/what-visa.html).\n\n* They must use the appropriate work permit, study permit or TRV application form for applicants outside Canada.

They may not be able to activate their work permit if they re-enter from the U.S. or Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon.\n * The length of the work permit is aligned with the permanent residence window (3 years or until the passport expires, whichever is first).\n\n#### Dependants\n\n* Dependants may be eligible to apply for an open work permit (LMIA exemption code C91).\n* Unless exempt, they may require and be eligible for a study permit. \n * For instructions regarding study permit eligibility or exemptions, consult [Temporary Residents: Students](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits.html).\n\n* Unless exempt, they may require and be eligible for a TRV. \n * For instructions regarding TRV requirements or exemptions, consult: [Temporary resident visas](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/what-visa.html). \n\n* They must use the appropriate work permit, study permit or TRV application form for applicants outside Canada.

The factors provided for each code demonstrate how the situation may meet the requirements of paragraph R205(a). Officers must also always be satisfied that the situation meets all requirements of sections [R200](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html) and [R201](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-201.html) (if they are applying to renew their work authorization).\n\nAdministrative code C90 is the code under which the work of certain foreign nationals in the specific National Occupational Classifications (NOCs) plays an important role in supporting Canadian families. As foreign nationals in transition to permanent residence, applicants under these pilots may create significant economic or social benefits.\n\nThere are [2 categories](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/occupation-restricted-open-work.html#s1) of permanent resident applicants under the pilots:\n\n* Gaining experience category ([Category A](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/terms-definitions-related-permanent-residence.html#cata))\n* Direct to permanent residence category ([Category B](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/terms-definitions-related-permanent-residence.html#catb))\n\nApplicants who belong to Category A must submit their work permit application with their permanent residence application online, and the requirements for permanent residence are assessed first. If applicants have less than 6 months of eligible work experience but meet all other requirements, they should be issued an occupation-restricted open work permit (OROWP) that will give them time to obtain the eligible work experience.

categories\n--------------------\n\nApplicants under the pilots are divided into 2 categories, depending on whether they have the eligible work experience:\n\n* The Gaining experience category ([Category A](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/terms-definitions-related-permanent-residence.html#cata)) is defined as a group of applicants (outside or within Canada) who have less than the required eligible work experience at the time of application submission.\n* The Direct to permanent residence category ([Category B](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/terms-definitions-related-permanent-residence.html#catb)) is defined as a group of applicants (outside or within Canada) who have already completed the required Canadian work experience in the following occupations on the date the permanent residence application under 1 of the pilots is made: \n * for applications assessed as per NOC 2016, either NOC 4411 or NOC 4412\n * for applications assessed as per NOC 2021, either NOC 44100 or NOC 44101\n\n* Combined work experience under the 2 NOCs is not counted. \n * Category B applicants are not eligible for an OROWP. However, they could be eligible to apply for a[BOWP](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/provincial-nominees-permanent-resident-applicants/bridging-open-work-permits.html)after receiving a positive eligibility decision on their application for permanent residence.\n\n**Important:** In some cases, the Category A applicant obtains the qualifying work experience **before** being issued an OROWP under this administrative code. Depending on the situation, officers may be required to issue an OROWP or a BOWP, or cancel the work permit application and issue the Confirmation of Permanent Residence (COPR). The officers are required to follow the process outlined in [Home Child Care Provider and Home Support Worker Pilot: Making a final decision – Proof of work experience received before OROWP approval](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/final-decision.html#proof-before-OROWP) and summarized below.\n\nIf the applicant is **in Canada**, and the permanent residence application passed eligibility, assess the work permit application under the [BOWP](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/provincial-nominees-permanent-resident-applicants/bridging-open-work-permits.html)guidance.\n\nIf the applicant is **overseas** or is**in Canada but not eligible for a BOWP,**proceed with the appropriate option below after the applicant has passed both the eligibility and the admissibility:\n\n* If the COPR**cannot** be issued at the moment, issue the work permit under the OROWP – C90 guidance. \n* If the COPR **can** be issued at the moment but the client is **in Canada**, issue the work permit under the OROWP – C90 guidance, **and** issue the COPR. (The applicant must be able to maintain valid temporary resident status.)\n* If the COPR **can** be issued and the client is **overseas**, cancel the work permit application, refund both the work permit processing fee and the open work permit holder fee, then issue the COPR.\n\nEligibility\n-----------\n\nTo be eligible for an OROWP under one of the pilots, the applicant must\n\n* apply for the OROWP **together with** their application for permanent residence\n* meet the [eligibility requirements under the HCCPP or HSWP](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/assessing-application-selection-criteria.html)*\n* have an eligible [job offer and be likely to accept it](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/assessing-application-selection-criteria.html#job-offer)*\n* be [able to perform the work](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/assessing-application-selection-criteria.html#ability) described in the lead statement of the occupational description of the NOC\n* have paid the work permit processing fee ($155) and the open work permit holder fee ($100)\n\n*[Special exemptions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots/final-decision.html#proof-before-OROWP) may apply to applicants who provide proof of Canadian work experience before OROWP approval.\n\nOfficers may consult the [HCCPP and HSWP instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/pathways-for-caregivers/child-care-provider-support-pilots.html) for guidance on permanent residence eligibility criteria, intake and processing.\n\n**Note:** Due to the requirement to submit the work permit with the permanent resident application, Gaining experience (Category A) applicants can’t submit their work permit application upon entry to Canada at the port of entry.\n\nReceipt of work permit applications\n-----------------------------------\n\nWork permit applications must be submitted online with applications for permanent residence through the Permanent Residence Portal.\n\nFor pilot application packages submitted via the Permanent Residence Portal, officers will find the work permit application listed as **Other** in the list of documents in the portal.\n\nFor pilot application packages submitted in an alternate format through regular mail, officers should find the correct paper version of the work permit application included with the permanent residence application and supporting documents.\n\nRegardless of the method of receipt, after the completed permanent residence application is created and promoted, the officer will\n\n* create the prospective work permit application in the Global Case Management System (GCMS)\n* promote the work permit application once all required data entry is complete"
