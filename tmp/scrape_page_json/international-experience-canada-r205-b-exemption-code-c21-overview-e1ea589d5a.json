This mandate will be achieved through the following 3 key objectives:\n\n* prioritize high-value bilateral relations and low-risk exchanges with other countries\n* facilitate applications from high-quality participants who fit Canada’s immigration priorities\n* increase reciprocity with other countries and enhance international opportunities for young Canadians\n\n### About the IEC program\n\nIEC supports Canada’s economic and cultural interests through Canada’s agreements (international treaties) and arrangements (memoranda of understanding) with over 35 countries and territories. Agreements and arrangements are open to Canadian and foreign youth aged 18 to 35. The reciprocal nature of these agreements and arrangements qualifies foreign youth for an LMIA-exempt work permit. Depending on the IEC category, the work permit may be employer specific or open.\n\nIEC also facilitates youth mobility opportunities through Canada-based work and travel service providers recognized by the program ([recognized organizations](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/international-experience/canadian-interests-reciprocal-employment-international-experience-canada-recognized-organizations-foreign-youth.html)).\n\nThe dynamic IEC electronic application (e-application) was deployed in November 2015 and allows candidates to submit their profile to an IEC pool. The system assesses whether they meet basic IEC eligibility requirements before enabling them to submit their profile to the pool and become candidates for the IEC program. Through campaigns managed by IRCC, candidates are invited to submit their complete work permit e-application to IRCC. The primary office for these applications is the electronic Processing and Intake Centre (ePIC) (previously Operations Support Centre (OSC)) at IRCC.\n\n### Framework\n\nCanadians and foreign nationals aged 18 to 35 can benefit from the IEC program under the following:\n\n1. [**Bilateral agreements and arrangements**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/international-experience/canadian-interests-reciprocal-employment-international-experience-canada-bilateral-agreements-arrangements.html) established by the Government of Canada with foreign governments.\n\nThere are 3 possible categories of participation through bilateral agreements and arrangements under the IEC program:\n\n * **Working Holiday** (travel and work): Participants are eligible to apply for an [open work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html) to allow them to work for any employer or location in Canada to subsidize their stay as they travel and discover their host country, Canada.\n * **Young Professionals** (career development): Participants are eligible to apply for an [employer-specific work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html) to help them gain targeted experience in their profession or field of study.\n * **International Co-op** (internships for students only): Participants in this internship category are eligible to apply for an employer-specific work permit to help them gain targeted experience in their field of study.\n\n2. **Recognized organizations**\n\nA recognized organization is a third-party Canada-based organization that facilitates international travel and work opportunities for foreign national and Canadian youth and whose programs and services are recognized by IEC. As part of their services, recognized organizations may provide support and general advice to foreign nationals applying under all 3 IEC streams throughout the application process, and may assist with their travel arrangements, provide orientation services or arrange their work placements. Recognized organizations provide their services for a fee. Each recognized organization is given an allotted number of candidate nominations in specific categories each year. For more information on recognized organizations, consult [IEC recognized organizations for foreign youth](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/international-experience/canadian-interests-reciprocal-employment-international-experience-canada-recognized-organizations-foreign-youth.html).\n\nWork permits issued under IEC are exempt from the requirement for a positive LMIA as per [paragraph 204(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/page-27.html#docCont), and the LMIA exemption code C21 is used.\n\n### Role and responsibilities\n\nThe IEC program is governed jointly by IRCC’s International Affairs and Crisis Response Sector and Economic Programs Sector, with processing completed by Service Delivery Sector. The following outlines each sector’s respective roles and responsibilities:\n\n#### International Affairs and Crisis Response Sector\n\n* negotiate reciprocal agreements and arrangements with foreign governments and implement the IEC program\n* negotiate and set annual reciprocal quotas (global level, country/territory level, and recognized organizations level)\n* conduct ongoing country/territory assessments to evaluate that agreements and arrangements meet the IEC program’s objectives\n* monitor program delivery for Canadians to assess reciprocity\n* provide functional guidance on IEC’s participation eligibility requirements\n* provide guidance and support to IEC hub missions (Sydney, Australia; Paris, France; Berlin, Germany; Tokyo, Japan; Seoul, South Korea; and Warsaw, Poland)\n* support the promotion and awareness of IEC abroad and to foreign youth in collaboration with IRCC’s missions\n* implement IEC’s engagement strategy to increase Canadian participation through partnering relationships with the following key sectors:\n * provinces and territories, and academic networks\n * Canadian private sector (including the travel and work sector)\n * other federal government departments and agencies, provincial, territorial and foreign governments\n * youth (including Indigenous youth and IEC alumni)\n * non-governmental organizations serving youth\n * ethno-cultural communities and diaspora communities\n\n* promote IEC to Canadians and foreign nationals through activities, including attending international and domestic conferences, workshops and fairs\n* develop promotional products and advertising campaigns for outreach to both foreign nationals and Canadians\n\n#### Economic Programs Sector\n\n##### Temporary Workers Program Division\n\n* provide functional guidance on the processing of work permits, including those connected with the IEC program\n\n#### Service Delivery Sector\n\n##### Electronic Processing and Intake Centre (ePIC), Immigration Operations Branch (IOB)\n\n* act as the primary office to process all IEC e-applications\n* verify the names, date of birth, country/territory of birth, and passport information, and make any necessary corrections, as per IRCC’s [Naming Policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/identity-management/naming-procedures/naming-policy-client-identification-purposes.html) and procedures\n* search the electronic databases to avoid duplicate unique client identification numbers and perform data integrity actions where necessary\n* assess IEC applicants’ eligibility and admissibility to apply under IEC and process work permit applications\n* request biometric fees, send the Biometrics Instruction Letter and assess biometric results\n* collect the IEC program fee, the open work permit holder fee (where applicable), and ensure that the employer compliance fee for an employer-specific work permit application has been paid\n* respond to **case-specific** enquiries from foreign nationals through the[IRCC Web form](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/contacts/web-form.asp) within 5 business days.\n * Note that ePIC does not respond to case-specific enquiries from foreign nationals whose work permit applications have been transferred to migration offices (consult the section on IRCC migration offices below).\n\n* issue port of entry (POE) letters of introduction to clients who have been found eligible to the IEC Program and admissible to Canada\n* asses reconsideration requests\n* [issue refunds](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/refunds/when-issued.html) to clients whose IEC applications have been refused or withdrawn and complete remissions according to the Service Fees Act\n\n##### IRCC migration offices, International Platform Branch (IPB)\n\n* promote the IEC program to the general public abroad\n* process all applications from foreign nationals who require a temporary resident visa\n\n**Note:** All IEC applications are promoted and reviewed for eligibility by ePIC before being referred to a migration office for a final decision. Prior to referring the case to migration offices, the ePIC officer should enter the following note in the remark section in the Global Case Management System (GCMS): “Eligibility assessed and passed. Admissibility determination referred to migration office <insert name of the migration office>”. \n* process complex cases referred by ePIC where local knowledge is required \n * This would include cases where there may be bona fide concerns, where clients may be inadmissible for complex criminality or on health grounds, or pursuant to sections [34](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-34.html), [35](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-35.html), or [37](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-37.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). The Electronic Processing and Intake Centre will also refer cases where the client requires an authorization to return to Canada or where a client has a second application in process at the migration office (for example, if the client has a second work permit application, an application for an authorization to return to Canada or an application for rehabilitation).\n\n#### Border services officers at ports of entry\n\n* verify the validity and accuracy of the POE letter of introduction (LOI), admissibility, biometrics results, medical results (if applicable) and proof of health insurance coverage\n* issue the work permit\n\nSee [best practices when issuing work permits at ports of entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/experience-processing-procedures.html#best-practices) for more information on processing applications at the port of entry.\n\n##### IEC applications at ports of entry\n\nExcept in the case of US citizens and permanent residents, the IRPR do not allow applicants to submit IEC work permit applications at a POE. Paragraph [R198(2)(c)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-198.html) stipulates that a foreign national may not apply for a work permit when entering Canada if the foreign national is a participant in an international youth exchange program, unless they are a national or permanent resident of the US or their e-application for a work permit was approved before their entry into Canada.\n\n**Note:** Although Canada and the US currently have no formal bilateral arrangement concerning youth mobility, US citizens and permanent residents may apply to IEC through [recognized organizations](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/international-experience/canadian-interests-reciprocal-employment-international-experience-canada-recognized-organizations-foreign-youth.html). They may [apply for their work permit online](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/iec/about.html) (recommended option) or at a POE [[R198(2)(c)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-198.html)], as long as they have the following documents:\n\n* a valid invitation to apply letter, which they can obtain only by first submitting their profile to an IEC pool\n* a copy of the confirmation letter from their recognized organization\n* an online fee payment receipt\n * IEC applicants must [pay their IEC](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/index.asp) fee (and other fees, if applicable) online before arriving at the POE.\n\nIf the US citizen or permanent resident is applying for an IEC work permit at the POE, the Canada Border Services Agency must assess the client for both eligibility and admissibility.\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2025-12-24",
