It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nIn these instructions, “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada(IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency(CBSA).\n\n**These measures came into effect on October 10,2024.**\n\nThese instructions are for IRCC officers to process applications received under the following measures (collectively referred to in these instructions as “the temporary measures”):\n\n* [Temporary public policy to exempt certain Indigenous persons and their family members from temporary residence requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/indigenous-temporary-resident.html) (“the public policy”)\n* [Temporary public policy to exempt certain Indigenous Persons and their family members from the requirement to pay fees for processing temporary residence applications and for the collection of biometric information](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/indigenous-fee-exemption.html) (“the fees public policy”)\n* [Ministerial Instructions 78 (MI78) regarding the issuance of Temporary Resident Permits to certain Indigenous persons and their family members](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions/other-goals/mi78.html) (“the MIs”)\n\nThese instructions are also for CBSA officers at the port of entry (POE) to issue documents approved under the temporary measures by IRCC before entry.\n\nThis cohort is eligible to apply for temporary resident documents, including open work permits and study permits valid for up to 3 years. The eligibility criteria and admissibility considerations covered by the temporary measures are unique, so officers should review these instructions carefully. Applications are processed on a priority basis.\n\nAs per the MIs, additional considerations must be taken into account when assessing requests, such as for temporary resident permits(TRPs) for eligible Indigenous persons, who may be issued a TRP with a validity of 6 months and up to 3 years.\n\nAll applicable eligibility and admissibility requirements not exempted under these measures must be met. If eligibility criteria specific to these measures are not met, clients may opt to apply under the regular streams for a temporary resident document.\n\n**Port of entry (POE)**: Indigenous persons and their family members are not eligible to apply for a temporary resident document under the temporary measures at the POE, with the exception of a family member who may seek admission as a visitor.\n\nOfficers can consider that even though they may be seeking entry to work or study, they may be admitted as a visitor in order to allow them to apply under the temporary measures from inside Canada.\n\nApplicant instructions: Temporary measures to reunite families of Indigenous people separated by Canada’s border\n\nOn this page\n------------\n\n* [Eligibility requirements for the

See [Family members of an eligible Indigenous person](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/indigenous-persons.html#a2).\n\n### Anchor member of the family in Canada\n\nAn anchor member of the family is a person who ties the main applicant to Canada. The anchor must be:\n\n* residing in Canada; and\n* a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or person registered under the Indian Act, regardless of age.\n\nAn anchor may have any of the following relationships with the main applicant:\n\n* spouse or common-law partner,\n* child (any age), stepchild, daughter-in-law, or son-in-law,\n* grandchild or great-grandchild,\n* parent, step-parent, or parent-in-law,\n* grandparent or great-grandparent,\n* sibling (including half-sibling) or step-sibling,\n* aunt or uncle, \n * brother or sister of their parent\n\n* niece or nephew, or \n * child of their brother or sister.\n\nThe main applicant must provide proof that the anchor member of their family meets the residence and status requirements, as well as evidence to establish a familial relationship between themselves and the anchor.\n\n### Types of applications required to be eligible for the public policy\n\n#### Applications for the eligible Indigenous person\n\nIn addition to the above, the eligible Indigenous person must have applied under the following categories using the prescribed form _(_[Application for a temporary resident document under the public policy for certain indigenous persons (IMM 0800)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/imm0800.html)):\n\n* a work permit under [section 200](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) either before or after entry to Canada, or a work permit renewal under [subsection R201(1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-201.html) after entry to Canada, where the duration of the work permit requested is for a maximum of 3 years [(parts 1 and 4 of the public policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/indigenous-temporary-resident.html));\n* a study permit under [section R216](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-216.html) either before or after entry to Canada, or a renewal of their study permit under [subsection R217(1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-217.html), either before or after entry to Canada ([parts 2 and 5 of the public policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/indigenous-temporary-resident.html));\n* an extension of temporary resident status from within Canada under [subsection R181(1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-181.html);

or\n* a restoration of temporary resident status from in Canada, under subsection R182(1), if applicable ([part 9 of the public policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/indigenous-temporary-resident.html)).\n\nEligible family members may apply either as accompanying family members on the main applicant’s application, or they may submit their own application to join the main applicant at a later time. If a family member is applying at a later time, the main applicant must have already submitted an application under these temporary measures.\n\n#### Individuals seeking to enter under the temporary measures at the port of entry (POE)\n\nEligible Indigenous persons seeking to enter Canada under the temporary measures at the POE as a worker or student ([part 3 of the public policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/indigenous-temporary-resident.html)) may do so only if:\n\n* they have already applied and been approved for a work permit under section R200 or a study permit under section R216 following facilitation under [part 1 or 2 of the public policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/indigenous-temporary-resident.html); **or**\n* they have applied and been approved for a temporary resident permit ([as per the MIs](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions/other-goals/mi78.html)).\n\nEligible family members seeking to enter Canada under the temporary measures at the POE ([part 8 of the public policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/indigenous-temporary-resident.html)) may do so only:\n\n* as a worker or student after having already applied and been approved for a work permit under section R200, or a study permit under section R216, following facilitation under [part 7 of the public policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/indigenous-temporary-resident.html);**or**\n* as a visitor\n\nAs part of the requirements for eligibility under the public policy, applications **must** be made before entry to Canada, or after entry to Canada, with the exception of eligible family members seeking to enter Canada under the temporary measures as a visitor. As such, all other applications received at the POE will not benefit from the exemptions applicable under the public policy and are subject to standard processing, including regular processing fees.\n\nIf an Indigenous person or their family members have applied for or provide confirmation that they want the officer to consider issuance of a temporary resident permit to overcome an inadmissibility, the temporary resident permit is fee exempt.\n\nFamily members of an eligible Indigenous person\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nFamily members (as defined under [subsection R1(3)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-1.html)) of an eligible Indigenous person (main applicant) may also apply for temporary residence under this public policy, either as accompanying family members or applying independently after the Indigenous person, if it is established that:\n\n* the family member of the Indigenous person (main applicant) meets the definition of a family member as per subsection R1(3);\n* the main applicant has included their eligible family members as accompanying family members, as part of the application they submitted under this policy, or has already submitted an application under this policy if the eligible family member is joining them later;\n* the main applicant is a citizen of the U.S. or was born in the U.S.; and\n* the main applicant is described under the section [**Eligible Indigenous persons (main applicant)**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/indigenous-persons.html#a1.1).\n\nFamily members of eligible Indigenous persons are not required to have Indigenous ancestry and are eligible regardless of nationality. Eligible family members may apply for an open work permit, study permit, visitor status in Canada or a TRP (if required).\n\nFamily members who are not U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the U.S. may require a temporary resident visa (TRV) or electronic travel authorization(eTA) to travel to Canada.\n\nThe steps to obtain a TRV or eTA depend on the type of application:\n\n* Family members who require a TRV and apply for a work or study permit will be issued a TRV as part of an approved application. The officer must request their passport in order to affix the counterfoil.\n* Family members who require a TRV but do not apply for a work or study permit may apply for a TRV under the public policy.\n* For visa-exempt family members, if required, an eTA will be automatically issued as part of an approved application for a work or study permit.\n* Family members who require an eTA and do not apply for a work or study permit should apply for an eTA through the usual route, which is subject to a $7 fee.\n\n### Accompanying family members of an Indigenous person\n\nFamily members must be included on the main applicant’s application for temporary resident processing under these temporary measures as accompanying family members. Only one application form (IMM 0800) is required for the family group (Indigenous person and their accompanying family members) if they are applying together.\n\nThe section “Information about your family members (both accompanying and non-accompanying)” of the form must be completed for each accompanying family member and proof of relationship to the main applicant must be provided. All accompanying family members over 18 must also each complete the “Background information” section.\n\n### Family members applying separately from the Indigenous person\n\nFamily members of an eligible Indigenous person may apply separately, but are required to complete a new IMM 0800 and must provide information for the Indigenous person including proof of their relationship to the Indigenous person. The Indigenous person must have previously submitted an application for temporary residence and have met eligibility requirements under the public policy in order for their family members to be eligible for processing under these temporary measures.\n\nTo be eligible for processing under this public policy, the family member must establish the following:\n\n1. Proof that the Indigenous person (main applicant) has previously applied for temporary residence under this public policy. Examples include: \n * a letter from IRCC indicating a positive final decision on their application\n * a copy of the immigration document that was issued to the Indigenous person\n * if the application is still under review, proof that an application was submitted to IRCC (proof of mailing etc.)\n * name and date of birth of the Indigenous person (main applicant). If the name and date of birth are provided, officers must do an Integrated Search in GCMS to locate the main applicant’s client history\n\n2. Evidence that the main applicant meets the requirements for processing under this public policy as an Indigenous person if their application has not been finalized\n3. Proof of familial relationship to the main applicant\n\nExemptions from certain conditions\n----------------------------------\n\nTemporary residents are usually subject to various conditions, such as the length of their stay in Canada ([section R183](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-183.html?term=183)); however, the [public policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/indigenous-temporary-resident.html) exempts eligible Indigenous persons and their accompanying family members from the following requirements:\n\n* to submit to a medical examination;

[section A39](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-39.html) (all parts of the public policy)\n* to not be inadmissible for misrepresentation only related to their entry to Canada, overstaying their temporary resident status and working or studying without authorization; [paragraph A40(1)(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-40.html) (all parts of the public policy)\n\n**Note:** Applicants inadmissible under any other misrepresentation are not exempt under the public policy and regular processing applies. \n* to not be inadmissible for non-compliance;

In these cases, a TRP may be considered in order to overcome an inadmissibility that an officer is aware of under any of the following provisions of the Act:\n\n* health grounds (section A38)\n* financial reasons (section A39)\n* for directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating only to their entry to Canada or working or studying without authorization (paragraph A40(1)(a))\n* through an act or omission which contravenes, directly or indirectly, a provision of this Act through non-compliance (paragraph A41(a))\n\nThe MIs request officers to consider granting Indigenous persons (and their eligible family members) a temporary resident permit to overcome the above inadmissibilities and to authorize them to enter or remain in Canada as temporary residents. See the section on TRP processing for more information.\n\nDocuments required to support applications made under the public policy and Ministerial Instructions\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo be eligible for processing under the temporary measures, the application must be submitted on paper to CPC-E. The applicant must complete and sign the [Application for a temporary resident document under the public policy for certain indigenous persons(IMM 0800)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/imm0800.html) form and provide all required documents and forms with their application submission.\n\nThe main applicant must establish that they meet the requirements by providing the following:\n\n1. [Proof of the main applicant’s Indigenous status](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/indigenous-persons.html#a5.1)\n2. [Proof of identity, including the main applicant’s U.S. citizenship](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/indigenous-persons.html#a5.2)\n3.

[Proof that the anchor member of the family is a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or person registered under the Indian Act](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/indigenous-persons.html#a5.4)\n5.

[Additional documents as required](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/indigenous-persons.html#a5.6)\n\n**Note:** A single identity document may serve as proof of identity, country of birth and Indigenous status. If the information is presented on one piece of identification (for example, an Enhanced Tribal Card (ETC)), then additional photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship may not be required.\n\n### Proof of the main applicant’s Indigenous status\n\nThe main applicant must be able to provide evidence of their membership in a Federally Recognized Tribe in the U.S.(USFRT) or citizenship in the Manitoba Métis Federation(MMF). See the section [Eligible Indigenous persons](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/indigenous-persons.html#a1.1).\n\nAcceptable documentation may include:\n\n* Photocopy of both sides of any of the following: \n * Enhanced Tribal Card (ETC)\n * U.S. tribal membership card\n * Manitoba Métis Federation Card\n\n* Attestation letter from an official of the tribe from which the applicant originates or notarized attestation from Chief and Council of U.S. Tribe \n * Such a statement would be on the tribe’s official letterhead and must confirm the applicant’s membership and/or ancestry\n\n* Other proof that establishes the applicant’s Indigenous status\n\n### Proof of identity, including U.S. citizenship\n\nApplicants must provide photocopies of documents showing their name, date of birth, place of birth (including state), and citizenship. If a single document does not have all of this information, a combination of valid pieces of identification that, when combined, are evidence of name, date of birth, place of birth and citizenship, may be accepted.\n\nExamples of acceptable documents that may be used to establish citizenship include:\n\n* passport or travel document (biographic page)\n* birth records (for example, birth certificate) (both sides)\n* U.S. citizenship card (both sides)\n* certificate of citizenship or naturalization (both sides)\n\nIf the proof of citizenship does not have a photo, the applicant must also provide photo identification.

Alternatively, the anchor member of the family may complete and sign the [Confirmation of family relationships (IMM 0802)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/imm0802.html)for the main applicant to include in their application.\n\nThe onus is on the main applicant to provide sufficient evidence to establish the familial relationship with the anchor member of the family. However, in cases where applicants have not provided sufficient evidence of the familial relationship, officers should request additional information that would satisfy the officer that the criterion has been met before continuing to process the application.\n\n#### Customary marriage and adoption\n\nIndigenous communities may practise customary care and customary marriage, meaning they may establish relationships according to their culture and customs.\n\nIf the applicant presents evidence of a customary marriage, officers should assess whether they are satisfied that the relationship meets the definition of common-law. If not, officers may use their discretion and assess these on a case-by-case basis.\n\nIf the applicant presents evidence of a customary adoption, these applications should be assessed on a case-by-case basis, taking into account factors such as the ability of the customary adoptive parent to act on behalf of the child when in Canada, and whether an officer is satisfied that a customary adoption has taken place. This can be established by provincial/territorial/state documentation (if applicable) and/or a number of statutory declarations from First Nation or Tribal leadership, community members and family.\n\nOfficers should also be satisfied that there is evidence to demonstrate that the adoptee was raised, or is being raised, as a minor by their adoptive parents. While these are the encouraged requirements, officers may also accept any credible evidence to demonstrate that a customary adoption has taken place and assess it on a case-by-case basis.\n\n### Proof that the anchor member of the family is a Canadian citizen, permanent resident, or person registered under the Indian Act\n\nIf not included with the application, officers could request evidence that the anchor member meets these criteria, which may include photocopies of:\n\n* Provincial or territorial birth certificate\n* Canadian passport biographical data page\n* Citizenship certificate\n* Permanent resident card\n* Record of Landing (IMM 1000)\n* Confirmation of Permanent Residence (IMM 5292 or IMM 5688)\n* Status card (Certificate of Indian Status (CIS) or Secure Certificate of Indian Status (SCIS) cards)\n\n### Proof that the anchor member of the family is residing in Canada\n\nIf not included with the application, officers could request evidence that the anchor member meets these criteria, which may include photocopies of:\n\n* a rental agreement\n* letters issued for utility or bank accounts\n* government-issued documents,including a driver’s licence or vehicle registration\n* other official documentation that clearly shows the anchor member of the family’s name and address.\n\n### Additional documents\n\nIn addition to the above, clients may also submit the following as part of a complete application:\n\n* two photographs meeting the requirements of the [Visa application photograph specifications](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/temporary-resident-visa-application-photograph-specifications.html)\n* proof of marital or [common-law relationship](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-1.html), if applicable\n* letter of acceptance from a Designated Learning Institution for each person applying for a study permit unless exempted under subsection R219(2)\n* a [Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ)](https://www.quebec.ca/en/education/study-quebec/temporary-selection-studies) issued by the Quebec Ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI) (for each family member who is applying for a study permit and plans to study in Quebec)\n* proof of current immigration status in country of residence (for accompanying family members who are not citizens of the country from which they are applying)\n* proof of relationship between the main applicant and each accompanying family member\n* photocopies of both sides of identity documents for each accompanying family member that show their full name, date of birth and place of birth\n\nIncomplete applications\n-----------------------\n\n**For IRCC:** If the applicant did not provide all of the documents and signed forms required to process their application, officers are encouraged to request any outstanding elements from the applicant. The officer may request missing components or additional information by email, if an email was provided, or by mail to the mailing address provided. The officer should send the letter “Incomplete application”. Applicants should follow the instructions provided on the letter.\n\n**For CBSA:** If not all documents are presented at the POE and the officer is not able to establish eligibility, all regular processing options exist.\n\nIneligible applicants (ineligible under both the public policy and the Ministerial Instructions)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nApplicants must meet all of the eligibility criteria to be approved. If the applicant is deemed ineligible under the temporary measures due to lack of proof or missing documentation, the officer is encouraged to consider requesting additional documentation to support the application.\n\nOfficers are encouraged to consider being flexible in the types of supporting documents they are willing to accept. If the applicant is ultimately unable to provide evidence to satisfy the officer that they are eligible under the temporary measures, the application should be returned for not meeting criteria under the public policy.\n\nApplication processing instructions\n-----------------------------------\n\nAll temporary resident documents issued under the temporary measures are to be issued for a validity period corresponding to whichever of the following comes first:\n\n* 3 years (as per the Ministerial Instructions and public policy); or\n* until the applicant’s passport expires; or\n* for study permits, the length of the program according to the Letter of Acceptance even if less than 3 years, plus 90 days.\n\n**Important:**Documents issued for dependant children cannot exceed the validity of the main applicant’s document.\n\n### Eligibility\n\nEligibility for processing under the public policy should be reviewed first as:\n\n1. an eligible [Indigenous person](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/indigenous-persons.html#a1.1) and their [relationship to an anchor](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/indigenous-persons.html#a1.2) member of the family in Canada, or\n2. a [family member of an eligible Indigenous person](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/indigenous-persons.html#a1.3.2).\n\nOnce the applicant is deemed to meet public policy eligibility, other eligibility criteria for the requested application(s) should be reviewed.

The eligibility criteria and admissibility considerations covered by the temporary measures are unique, so officers should review these instructions carefully. Applications are processed on a priority basis.\n\nAs per the MIs, additional considerations must be taken into account when assessing requests, such as for temporary resident permits(TRPs) for eligible Indigenous persons, who may be issued a TRP with a validity of 6 months and up to 3 years.\n\nAll applicable eligibility and admissibility requirements not exempted under these measures must be met. If eligibility criteria specific to these measures are not met, clients may opt to apply under the regular streams for a temporary resident document.\n\n**Port of entry (POE)**: Indigenous persons and their family members are not eligible to apply for a temporary resident document under the temporary measures at the POE, with the exception of a family member who may seek admission as a visitor.\n\nOfficers can consider that even though they may be seeking entry to work or study, they may be admitted as a visitor in order to allow them to apply under the temporary measures from inside Canada.\n\nApplicant instructions: Temporary measures to reunite families of Indigenous people separated by Canada’s border\n\nOn this page\n------------\n\n* [Eligibility requirements for the

Possession of a TRV does not guarantee entry to Canada.\n\nIndividuals who meet a TRV exemption under [section R190](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-190.html), such as an American citizen or a U.S. permanent resident, do not require a TRV to enter Canada. Only certain eligible family members (accompanying or following) may require a TRV to travel to Canada.\n\nApplicants within this cohort are eligible to apply for a multiple-entry TRV under the temporary measures. As per the [Issuing a visa PDI](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/three-types-visas.html) , officers may exercise their judgment in deciding whether to issue a single or multiple-entry visa but should take into consideration the facilitative intent of the temporary measures in considering a single or multiple-entry visa."
