Typical examples of business activities include, but are not limited to, consultation, negotiation, discussion, research, participation in educational, professional or business conventions or meetings and soliciting business.\n\nThe following are the permissible business activities under [Appendix 1203.A.1](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/peru-perou/fta-ale/12.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Appendix%201203.A.1%20%2D%20Business%20Visitors):\n\n* [Meetings and consultations](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/internationals-ftas-canada-peru/business-visitors.html#s2.1)\n* [Research and design](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/internationals-ftas-canada-peru/business-visitors.html#s2.2)\n* [Growth, manufacture, and production](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/internationals-ftas-canada-peru/business-visitors.html#s2.3)\n* [Marketing](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/internationals-ftas-canada-peru/business-visitors.html#s2.4)\n* [Sales](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/internationals-ftas-canada-peru/business-visitors.html#s2.5)\n* [Distribution](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/internationals-ftas-canada-peru/business-visitors.html#s2.6)\n* [General service](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/internationals-ftas-canada-peru/business-visitors.html#s2.7)\n* [After-sales or after-lease service](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/internationals-ftas-canada-peru/business-visitors.html#s2.8)\n\nWhere an activity is not listed in[Appendix 1203.A.1](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/peru-perou/fta-ale/12.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Appendix%201203.A.1%20%2D%20Business%20Visitors), officers should continue to assess the applicant against the general Business Visitor provisions found in the IRPR and the [related PDIs](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/business.html).\n\nThe term “commercial transaction” found in some provisions in Chapter 12 of the CPFTA may be described as any act within the confines of the law that is performed expressly to derive a profit. Commercial transactions refer to discussions and negotiations in respect to the sale, purchase, marketing, distribution, advertisement, procurement, transmission, transportation or packaging of goods or services.\n\n### Meetings and consultations\n\n* Business persons attending meetings, seminars, or conferences; or engaged in consultations with business associates.\n\n### Research and design\n\n* Technical, scientific and statistical researchers conducting independent research or research for an [enterprise](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#e1) located in the territory of the other Party.\n\n### Growth, manufacture, and production\n\n* Purchasing and production management personnel conducting [commercial transactions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#c2) for an enterprise located in the territory of the other Party.\n* [Harvester](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#h) owner supervising a harvesting crew.\n\n### Marketing\n\n* Market researchers and analysts conducting independent research or analysis or research or analysis for an enterprise located in the territory of the other Party.\n* Trade fair and promotional personnel attending a trade convention to only promote their product may be granted entry under this provision.

An individual who is to be paid in Canada would be considered to be joining the labour market and could not be authorized to enter Canada as a business visitor, whereas, professionals whose primary source of remuneration for the business activity remains outside Canada may qualify.\n\n* Management and supervisory personnel engaging in a commercial transaction for an enterprise located in the territory of the other Party.\n* Financial services personnel (insurers, bankers or investment brokers) engaging in commercial transactions for an enterprise located in the territory of the other Party.\n* Public relations and advertising personnel consulting with [business associates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#b1), or attending or participating in conventions.\n* Tourism personnel (tour and travel agents, tour guides or tour operators) attending or participating in conventions or conducting a tour that has begun in the territory of the other Party.\n* Cook personnel (cookers and assistants) attending or participating in gastronomic events or exhibitions, or consulting with business associates.\n* Translators or interpreters performing services as employees of an enterprise located in the territory of the other Party.\n* Information and communication technology service providers attending meetings, seminars or conferences, or engaged in consultations with business associates.\n* Franchise traders and developers which seek to offer their services in the territory of the other Party.\n\n### After-sales or after-lease service\n\nAfter-sales or after-lease service includes the installation, repair, or servicing of commercial, industrial equipment, machinery, or computer software.\n\nInstallation includes setting up and testing of the commercial, industrial equipment, machinery, or computer software. It does **not** include operating the equipment or machinery, or computer software for production.\n\n#### Specific eligibility requirements for after-sales service\n\nThe following requirements apply to business visitors seeking entry under the after-sales or after-lease service provisions of CPFTA:\n\n* citizen or permanent resident of Peru, who is employed by an enterprise established in Peru;\n* purpose of entry is to install, repair, service, or supervise these functions, or train workers to perform services;\n* work is pursuant to original sales contract and any warranty or service agreement incidental (connected) to the sale of equipment or machinery (including computer software)\n* equipment or machinery (including computer software) is commercial or industrial (not for household or personal use);\n* equipment or machinery or computer software was manufactured and purchased outside Canada;\n* work is carried out during the validity of any warranty or service agreement or any extensions of same;\n* work requires specialized knowledge (which excludes hands-on building and construction work); and\n* compliance with existing immigration requirements for temporary entry.\n\n**Note:** persons granted entry to train or to supervise training may also train or supervise workers who are doing the hands-on building and construction work. This may require demonstrating certain procedures. The demonstration must not result in the completion of an [installation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#i1) or servicing task, or of part of such task, or in the productive operation of the equipment or machinery.\n\nThe CPFTA **does not** relieve after-sales or after-lease service personnel, or any other business person, from the obligation to comply with municipal, regional, provincial/territorial, or other federal requirements where these apply.\n\n#### Work that does not meet the eligibility requirements of after-sales or after-lease service\n\nPersons whose activities or services in Canada would constitute hands-on building and construction work may **not** enter under [R186(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) and the CPFTA as after-sales or after-lease service.\n\nGenerally the entry of foreign tradespersons in the building and construction industry is subject to an assessment of the availability of domestic labour (an LMIA). As part of the LMIA process, Service Canada will consult with organized labour prior to making a determination.\n\nFor personnel performing the installation or servicing, entry should not be granted when performing hands-on building and construction work. The performance of these activities are not permitted, regardless of wording in sales, warranty or service agreements supporting they be completed.\n\n**Building and construction work:** includes installing, maintaining, and repairing utility services, any part of the fabric of any building or structure, or machinery, equipment, or structures within a building.\n\nBuilding and construction work includes activities normally performed by (but not limited to):\n\n* labourers;\n* millwrights;\n* heat and frost insulators;\n* bricklayers;\n* carpenters and joiners;\n* electrical workers;\n* operating engineers (includes heavy equipment operators);\n* elevator constructors;\n* sheet metal workers;\n* teamsters;\n* boilermakers;\n* residential, commercial, or industrial painters (including the application of all service coatings no matter how applied);\n* bridge, structural, and ornamental ironworkers;\n* plumbers and pipefitters;\n* roofers;\n* plasterers and cement masons.\n\nBuilding and construction work includes work involving:\n\n* assembly lines;\n* conveyor belts and systems;\n* overhead cranes;\n* heating, cooling, and ventilation or exhaust systems;\n* elevators and escalators;\n* boilers and turbines; and\n* dismantling or demolition of commercial or industrial equipment or machinery, whether on-site or in-plant.\n\nDocumentary evidence\n--------------------\n\nUnder [Annex 1203, Section A](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/peru-perou/fta-ale/12.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Section%20A%20%2D%20Business%20Visitors) of the CPFTA, a business visitor must provide the following documentation:\n\n* proof of Peruvian nationality, citizenship or permanent residency status;\n* documentation demonstrating that the business person will be engaged in a business activity set out in Appendix 1203.A.1 and describing the purpose of entry; and\n* evidence that the business activity is international in scope and that they are not attempting to enter the Canadian labour market. \n * the primary source of remuneration is outside Canada, and\n * the person’s place of business remains outside Canada and the profits of the business are accumulated primarily outside Canada.\n\nOral declaration as to the principal place of business and the actual place of accrual of profits can be used as documentary evidence. If further proof is requested, a letter from the employer or the representing organization is sufficient. Prior approval procedures, labour certification tests, or other similar procedures cannot be required. Every effort should be made to avoid the requirement of a visa.\n\nIn general, an individual who is to be paid in Canada would be considered to be joining the labour market and could not be authorized to enter Canada as a business visitor. The payment of expenses incidental to the trip is allowed, as is an honorarium.\n\n### Documentary evidence for after-sales or after-lease service\n\nBusiness visitors applying under the after-sales or after-lease service provision of [Appendix 1203.A.1](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/peru-perou/fta-ale/12.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Section%20A%20%2D%20Business%20Visitors) of the CPFTA should be referred for a secondary examination when seeking entry, due to the complexity of the application and for reasons of client service and program consistency.\n\nThe following documentation is required:\n\n* proof of Peruvian citizenship, nationality or permanent residency; and\n* copies of the original sales or lease agreement, and warranty or service agreement, including extensions, which clearly support the purpose of entry.\n\nThe warranty or service contract must be incidental to, or connected to the sale or lease of commercial or industrial equipment or machinery, including computer software.\n\nThe warranty or service agreement does not need to have the same date as the sales or lease agreement. Particularly with third party service as it may take a number of months after the sale before the company installing or servicing the machinery is identified and sub-contracted.\n\nThe initial warranty or service agreement may be extended provided that the sales or lease agreement, or initial warranty or service agreement contained a provision allowing for the extension. The after-sales or after-lease service, therefore, continues to be contracted as part of the sale or lease of the equipment or machinery, or computer software.\n\n### Third party service\n\nIf [third party service](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#t3) occurs, there must be clear wording in the sales or lease agreement that specifies a third party will perform the installation, warranty, or service work. Unless such wording exists, there is no evidence that the third party service is incidental to the sale or lease. However, the firm need not be named in the agreement, as it may take some time for the firm to be identified. When a third party is not named in the sales or lease agreement, business visitors may be expected to provide a letter from the seller of the equipment that identifies them as the third party referenced in the original sales or lease agreement.\n\nWhen a seller or lessor located in the Peru contracts the after-sales or after-lease servicing to a third party, the third party must also be established in Peru.\n\n### Lack of Documentation\n\nEvery effort should be made to allow documentation to be provided (e.g., by fax, email or verbal explanation) from the company in Canada or the business visitor’s employer in Peru.\n\nThe requirement for documentation has been imposed in order to clearly establish that the proposed activity is incidental or connected to the sale or lease of the equipment or machinery or computer software.\n\nA verbal statement that the business of the applicant is being carried on outside Canada can be acceptable. Alternative indications (business cards, business papers, advertising pamphlets, etc.) may be helpful.\n\nFinal Decision\n--------------\n\n### Visitor record\n\nA business visitor’s stay in Canada will usually be short-term (up to 90 days, renewable for 30 days).\n\nIt is recommended that border services officers consider issuing a [visitor record](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/visitor-record.html) to a business visitor engaged in ‘after-sales service or after-lease service’ work for a period of longer than 6 months and indicate in the “Remarks” section why a longer period of time is being granted.\n\nThese visits may take place over a period of weeks or months. In these circumstances, border services officers should consider issuing a visitor record to reduce potential referrals on future entries.\n\nApplications for extension of status should be determined based on whether the foreign national remains eligible.\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2024-10-03",
