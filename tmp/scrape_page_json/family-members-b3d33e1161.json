If the family member **has passed** an immigration medical examination, no occupational restrictions should be added. |\n| **Biometrics** | There is no specific exemption for a foreign national entering Canada as a family member of a military member or designated civilian component. |\n| **Fees** | Work permit fee exempt: **E03** [[R299(2)(g)(ii)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-299.html)] Open work permit holder fee exempt: **P01** [[R303.2(2)(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-303.2.html)] Biometric fee exempt: **B18** [[R315.1(2)(d)(iv)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-315.1.html)] |\n\n### Approval - No reciprocal agreement\n\nUnder the “Application” screen, officers should enter the following information in the specified fields.\n\n| Field | Selection or input |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Case type** | 20 |\n| **Province of destination** | Unknown |\n| **Exemption code** | C41 - Spouse of a high-skilled worker |\n| **Employer** | Open |\n| **Intended occupation** | Open |\n| **NOC** | 99999 |\n| **Duration** | The open work permit may be issued for a period that ends no later than the period of authorized stay of the principal foreign national or the date the applicant’s passport expires, whichever comes first. |\n| **Conditions** | Officers should ensure that instructions provided in [Medical conditions to be imposed for open employer but occupation-restricted work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html#conditions-restricted) and [Work permit issuance in GCMS: Occupation or location restricted](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html#issuance-restricted) are followed. |\n| **User remarks Mandatory** | The following remark must be added to all open work permits **Authorized to work as per applicable labour laws.** |\n| **Fees** | There are no fee exemptions for spouses from non-designated VFA countries. $155 work permit processing fee $100 open work permit holder fee |\n| **Biometrics** | Work permit applicants are required to provide biometric information and pay the biometric fee - $85 The regular biometric exemptions apply (for example, under 14 or 1 in 10 rule). |\n\n### Refusals\n\nWhen officers are not satisfied that the specific eligibility factors for this administrative code are met, they need to clearly document their reasons in the refusal note.\n\nA decision is reasonable when the reviewing court is able to trace the decision maker’s rationale without encountering fatal flaws in the overarching logic and is satisfied that there is a line of analysis within the given reasons that could lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the decision maker’s conclusion.\n\nThe officer needs to engage with the documentary evidence that was provided by the applicant. Simply stating, “I have reviewed the submissions, and I am not satisfied that section R205(b) [or section R205(c)] is met”, is not sufficient for another reasonable person to understand the logic of the decision without reviewing all of the evidence again.\n\nIf an officer has determined that the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements, the work permit application should be refused. Officers should follow the steps in [Decision-making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html) when finalizing their refusal notes.\n\nThe grounds in the refusal letter should reflect what the officer has stated in their notes.\n\nWork permits shall be issued if all of the requirements stated in [section R200](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html) are met. Therefore, refusal grounds should be linked to one of those requirements. Below is an example of the requirements:\n\n* **R200(1)(c)(ii)** - The applicant has not met the eligibility requirements of the International Mobility Program work permit category. Officers need to explain clearly what eligibility requirements were not met.\n* **For example:** The spouse is applying under R205(c)(ii) for a C41 open work permit. The principal foreign national holds a work permit that is valid for a period of less than 16 months **after** the receipt date of the spousal open work permit application. The work permit application should be refused under subparagraph R200(1)(c)(ii), since their work is not described in section R205. The applicant has not provided proof showing the principal foreign national is authorized (that the work permit issued) or is provisionally approved (that the letter of introduction was issued) to work in Canada for a period of 16 months or longer **after** the receipt date of the spousal open work permit application. They do not meet the eligibility requirements that would make their work described in section R205.\n\nUseful links\n------------\n\n* [Military personnel [R186(d)] - Authorization to work without a work permit: International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/military.html)\n* [Spouses or common-law partners of foreign nationals authorized to work in high-skilled occupations TEER 0 or 1, or select occupations TEER 2 or 3) [R205(c)(ii) - C41] Canadian interest - International Mobility Program (IMP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/spouses-common-law-authorized-work-high-skilled-occupations.html)\n* [Temporary resident visas: Exemption for military members of countries designated for the purposes of the Visiting Forces Act](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/countries-designated-purposes-visiting-forces-act.html)\n\nPrevious updates\n----------------\n\n* [January 26, 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/updates/2024-imp-military-personeel-family.html)\n* [September 07, 2023](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/updates/2023-military-personnel-work.html)\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2025-11-14",

Simply stating, “I have reviewed the submissions, and I am not satisfied that section R205(b) [or section R205(c)] is met”, is not sufficient for another reasonable person to understand the logic of the decision without reviewing all of the evidence again.\n\nIf an officer has determined that the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements, the work permit application should be refused. Officers should follow the steps in [Decision-making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html) when finalizing their refusal notes.\n\nThe grounds in the refusal letter should reflect what the officer has stated in their notes.\n\nWork permits shall be issued if all of the requirements stated in [section R200](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html) are met.

Below is an example of the requirements:\n\n* **R200(1)(c)(ii)** - The applicant has not met the eligibility requirements of the International Mobility Program work permit category. Officers need to explain clearly what eligibility requirements were not met.\n* **For example:** The spouse is applying under R205(c)(ii) for a C41 open work permit. The principal foreign national holds a work permit that is valid for a period of less than 16 months **after** the receipt date of the spousal open work permit application. The work permit application should be refused under subparagraph R200(1)(c)(ii), since their work is not described in section R205. The applicant has not provided proof showing the principal foreign national is authorized (that the work permit issued) or is provisionally approved (that the letter of introduction was issued) to work in Canada for a period of 16 months or longer **after** the receipt date of the spousal open work permit application. They do not meet the eligibility requirements that would make their work described in section R205.\n\nUseful links\n------------\n\n* [Military personnel [R186(d)] - Authorization to work without a work permit: International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/military.html)\n* [Spouses or common-law partners of foreign nationals authorized to work in high-skilled occupations TEER 0 or 1, or select occupations TEER 2 or 3) [R205(c)(ii) - C41] Canadian interest - International Mobility Program (IMP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/spouses-common-law-authorized-work-high-skilled-occupations.html)\n* [Temporary resident visas: Exemption for military members of countries designated for the purposes of the Visiting Forces Act](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/countries-designated-purposes-visiting-forces-act.html)\n\nPrevious updates\n----------------\n\n* [January 26, 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/updates/2024-imp-military-personeel-family.html)\n* [September 07, 2023](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/updates/2023-military-personnel-work.html)\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2025-11-14"
