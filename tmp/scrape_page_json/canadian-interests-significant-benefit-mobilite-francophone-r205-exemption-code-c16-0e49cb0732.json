For example: Is this the sixth supervisor to be hired even though there is a total of only 10 employees? |\n| Wages | Are the wages equal to the minimum wage of the province or territory? Are they reasonable for the position? Can the employer afford to pay the wages based on their reported income? |\n| Duties and Job Requirements | Do the activities that the foreign national will be performing align with the exemption category and the occupation stated? Are there specific requirements that align with the exemption (for example, specific educational level, employment experience qualifications, etc.)? Has the applicant provided sufficient evidence that they meet the employment requirements? |\n\n### Program integrity\n\nOfficers may consider the following questions:\n\n* Has this employer recently hired many employees from the same region for the same position?\n* Does the contact information for the employer match the name of the company?\n\nExtension\n---------\n\nFor applications submitted **on or after June 15, 2023**, the determination of whether the applicant has a **moderate** French-language proficiency at the CLB or NCLC[level 5 or higher](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/language-requirements/test-equivalency-charts.html) was made at the time of initial application; therefore, a proof-of-language test result is not required upon renewal unless the processing officer has concerns.\n\nFor applications submitted **before June 15, 2023**, the determination of whether the applicant’s **habitual**language of daily use is French was made at the time of initial application; therefore, a proof-of-language test result is not required upon renewal unless the processing officer has concerns.\n\nAll other requirements must be met by the applicant renewing a work permit under this administrative code.\n\nFinal decision\n--------------\n\n### Approval\n\nFor applications submitted**on or after June 15, 2023,**the work permit will be issued under the authority of subparagraph R205(c)(ii).\n\nFor applications submitted **before June 15, 2023,** the work permit will be issued under the authority of paragraph R205(a).\n\nIn the Global Case Management System (GCMS), on the Application screen, officers should enter the information below in the specified fields:\n\n| Field | Selection or input |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case type | 52 – Employer-specific LMIA-exempt application |\n| Province of destination | Outside of Quebec and matching the employment address in the**Employment Details – LMIA-exempt**tab **Note:**If there is more than 1 location, officers should enter the primary location in the “Province of Destination” field and the secondary location in the “Remarks” field. |\n| City of destination | The city of destination entered by the applicant should match the address of employment in the IMP offer of employment (under the**Employment Details – LMIA-exempt**tab). **Note:**If there is more than 1 location, officers should enter the primary location in the “City of destination” field and the secondary location in the “Remarks” field. |\n| Exemption code | C16 This code is auto-populated from the IMP offer of employment. This code should only be changed in specific circumstances.

If the work permit application was submitted on paper, the officer must manually enter the number. |\n| Employer | Business operating name |\n| Duration | Officers may issue an IMP work permit that is valid for the duration of the offer of employment or until the expiry of the travel document, whichever is earlier. If the foreign national is exempt from the travel document requirement (for example, they are a US citizen), the work permit should be issued for the full duration of the offer of employment.
