Facilitating access to open work permits may help employers fill those positions and help to prevent some workers from having to quit their jobs and leave the country.\n\nThis public policy will permit eligible PGWP holders and former PGWP holders\n\n* in Canada to work without authorization in the short term (however, this authorization does not in itself provide status in Canada or authorization to return to Canada)\n* to apply from within Canada for an open work permit and facilitate restoration of their status, if applicable\n* who left Canada to apply for an open work permit from outside Canada\n\nInterim work authorization\n--------------------------\n\nInterim work authorization (IWA) letters were sent on April 5, 2023, to PGWP holders whose permits expire between September 20, 2021, and December 31, 2023. The IWA authorizes holders to begin or continue working in Canada until May 31, 2024, while they apply for a new open work permit under the public policy and await a decision on the application.\n\nThe IWA does not confer temporary resident status. Therefore, if the IWA holder loses their temporary resident status, time spent working under an IWA without status does not count towards Canadian work experience for the purposes of transitioning to permanent residency or accessing provincial health care services.\n\nForeign nationals are responsible for holding and maintaining their temporary resident status. The IWA cannot be used to travel or obtain entry to Canada.\n\nEligibility\n-----------\n\nTo be eligible under this public policy, the foreign national must meet the criteria below.\n\nThe foreign national:\n\n* held or holds a PGWP with an expiry date between September 20, 2021, and December 31, 2023\n* applied online for an open work permit between April 6, 2023, and December 31, 2023.
