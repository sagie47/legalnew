It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nForeign nationals who are in Canada as temporary residents and are seeking to extend their temporary resident status or their authorization to work or study **must apply** by electronic means only, unless otherwise specified.\n\nOn June 4, 2019, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) were amended to make an electronic application mandatory for most temporary residence applications made from within Canada. Specifically, section R9.2 provides that the following applications must be made by the electronic means made available or specified by the Minister for that purpose:\n\n* an application for an extension of an authorization to remain in Canada as a temporary resident\n* an application that is made in Canada for a work or study permit or for renewal of such a permit\n* an application for the restoration of temporary resident status\n* an application that is made pursuant to a youth mobility arrangement entered into by Canada\n\nOn this page\n------------\n\n* [Exceptions – Use of other means](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/place-application-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-study-permit-work-permit/exempt-electronic-applications.html#exceptions)\n * [Exceptional circumstances beyond the control of foreign nationals, individuals or entities](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/place-application-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-study-permit-work-permit/exempt-electronic-applications.html#circumstances)\n * [Disability](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/place-application-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-study-permit-work-permit/exempt-electronic-applications.html#disability)\n * [System restrictions (IRCC Secure Account)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/place-application-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-study-permit-work-permit/exempt-electronic-applications.html#restrictions)\n\nExceptions — Use of other means\n-------------------------------\n\nClients may use means other than the electronic option if they meet one of the following exceptions:\n\n### Exceptional circumstances beyond the control of foreign nationals, individuals or entities\n\nSection [R9.4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-9.4.html) provides for an exception to the mandatory electronic application submission if the Minister determines that\n\n* the infrastructure in a country is inadequate or incompatible with the electronic means made available or specified by the Minister for that purpose\n* a natural disaster, political turmoil or other situation prevents or impedes the use of electronic means or makes using them unreliable\n\n### Disability\n\nA foreign national or an individual who, because of a disability, is unable to meet a requirement to make an electronic application may do so by any other means that is made available or specified by the Minister for that purpose, such as the paper application form [[R9.5](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-9.5.html)].\n\nAt this time, the other means made available is the paper application. Applicants in Canada are not required to specify their disability. Officers should accept the paper application if it is complete.\n\n### System restrictions (IRCC Secure Account)\n\nApplicants must use the [IRCC Secure Account](https://www.canada.ca/content/canadasite/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account.html) (referred to as MyAccount or MyCIC Account) to submit their application electronically. Applicants must create a GCKey or use a Sign-In Partner to access their secure account.\n\nThe individual secure account requires applicants to go through a question flow to create their personalized document checklist. The question flow is available outside of the IRCC secure account as the[Come to Canada tool](https://www.canada.ca/content/canadasite/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/come-canada-tool.html).\n\n**Note:** Authorized paid representatives with access to the [Authorized Paid Representatives Portal](https://www.canada.ca/content/canadasite/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/partners-service-providers/authorized-paid-representatives-portal.html) are required to submit applications electronically on behalf of their clients. Since representatives select the documents they wish to upload instead of having a personalized document list provided based on the logic of the question flow, representatives should be able to submit all applications using the Authorized Paid Representatives Portal. Representatives may submit an application on paper under one of the programs in the list below if they are not able to submit the application through the Authorized Paid Representatives Portal.\n\nThe Minister has determined that the question flow in the individual secure account is inadequate for specific applicants inside Canada. As a result, these applicants are exempt from the mandatory online application.\n\nThe following is a list of the exemptions from the mandatory electronic application process for persons applying inside Canada.\n\n#### System restrictions – Specific exemption details\n\n| Permit category | Program |\n| --- | --- |\n| [A75](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/provincial-nominees-permanent-resident-applicants/bridging-open-work-permits.html) | Bridging open work permit applicants in Canada who used Express Entry to submit their permanent residence application and have received an acknowledgment of receipt letter. |\n| [C10](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/quebec-cases/quebec-physicians.html) | Quebec physicians |\n| [C21](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/international-experience/canadian-interests-reciprocal-employment-increasing-validity-period-work-permits-under-international-experience-canada.html) | International Experience Canada (IEC) participants changing the period of participation or employer after their initial work permit is issued. |\n| [C43](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/public-policy-competitiveness-economy.html#post-grad) | Post-graduation work permit extensions where the applicant did not receive the full authorized period allowed. |\n| [H81](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/humanitarian-reasons-r208.html) | Destitute students |\n| [H82](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/humanitarian-reasons-r208.html) | Holders of a temporary resident permit valid for a minimum of 6 months.
