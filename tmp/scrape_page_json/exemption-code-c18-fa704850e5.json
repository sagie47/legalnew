It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nIn these instructions, \"officer\" refers to an employee of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). These instructions do not apply to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), as applicants are not eligible to apply for this program at the port of entry.\n\nThe Atlantic Immigration Class, referred to as the Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP), was established through [regulations on January 1, 2022](https://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2021/2021-12-22/html/sor-dors242-eng.html). The goal of this program is to attract and retain skilled immigrants and international graduates in Atlantic Canada through an employer-driven approach.\n\nThe Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program (AIPP) agreements expired on December 31, 2021, with the expiration of the pilot bilateral agreements.\n\n**Transition provisions**: IRCC included transition provisions in the new bilateral agreements, starting January 1, 2022, which provide the following authority:\n\n1. to accept and process**complete** work permit applications under the AIPP received up to [midnight UTC](https://time.is/UTC) on March 5, 2022 \n * Processing may continue beyond this date so long as the **complete** application was received by March 5, 2022.\n\n2. to accept work permit renewal applications under the AIPP for applicants who have submitted their complete application for permanent residence on or before March 5, 2022, and are still waiting for a decision \n * These work permit applications will be assessed against the AIPP work permit requirements.\n\nCategories under the AIPP include\n\n* Atlantic High-Skilled Program\n* Atlantic Intermediate-Skilled Program\n* Atlantic

When assessing if the applicant can perform the work sought as per [paragraph R200(3)(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html), officers should consider all of the following:\n\n* that the employer is satisfied the applicant can perform the higher-level occupation\n* that the employer has worked with a settlement service provider organization to develop a settlement plan for the employee and their family\n* that the province has assessed the offer and determined that it is genuine as per the agreement\n* that during their work experience at the lower-level occupation, the applicant may have performed some of the duties of the higher-level occupation\n\n**Important**: The offer of employment cannot be for a lower-level occupation than the qualifying work experience. For example, an applicant who has worked as a fish plant manager cannot be approved if they accept an offer as a seafood worker.\n\nFor example, where an application is received between January 1, 2022, and November 15, 2022, **or** an application is received on or after November 16, 2022, where the provincial endorsement included was issued under NOC 2016:\n\n* An applicant has worked as a fish and seafood plant worker under NOC 9463, a NOC level C occupation.\n* The offer of employment under the AIP is for a fish processing supervisor under NOC 9213, a NOC level B occupation.\n* The worker may have sufficient years of experience, so they could progress easily to the higher occupation, or they may have acted in that occupation, so they have sufficient experience to satisfy an officer that they can perform the work sought.\n\nFor example, where an application is received on or after November 16, 2022, and the provincial endorsement letter was issued after November 16, 2022, under **NOC 2021**:\n\n* An applicant has worked as a fish and seafood plant worker under NOC 94142, a TEER 4 occupation.\n* The offer of employment under the AIP is for a fish processing supervisor under NOC 92012, a TEER 2 occupation.\n* The worker may have sufficient years of experience, so they could progress easily to the higher occupation, or they may have acted in that occupation, so they have sufficient experience to satisfy an officer that they can perform the work sought.\n\n**Note:** The only exception to approving a lower-level occupation than in the work experience is where the experience was acquired while working as either\n\n* a registered nurse (NOC 31301[on or after November 16,2022] or NOC 3012[on or before November 15,2022]), **or**\n* a licensed practical nurse (NOC 32101[after November 16,2022] or NOC 3233[on or before November 15,2022]), and they are being offered employment as a nurse’s aide, orderly or patient services associate (NOC 33102 [on or after November 16,2022] or NOC 3413 [on or before November 15,2022]) or as a home support worker (NOC 44101 [on or after November 16,2022] or NOC 4412 [on or before November 15,2022])\n\nAtlantic Immigration Pilot Programs (AIPP) requirements\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n### AIPP official language proficiency\n\nForeign nationals applying for a work permit under the pilot, and who received an endorsement certificate on or before December 31, 2021, must provide a **copy** of a [language test](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/language-testing.html) approved by IRCC that shows the applicant meets either the minimum language level of 4 in either the Canadian Language Benchmarks in English or the Niveaux de compétence linguistique canadiens in French for each of the 4 language skill areas.\n\n**Note:** The test results must be less than 2 years old on the date of the work permit application.\n\nSee the [language requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/language-requirements.html) section for evidence of language proficiency.\n\n### AIPP education requirement\n\n#### Atlantic International Graduate Program\n\nThe applicant must demonstrate that they **meet all** of the following minimum education and residence requirements:\n\n* that, as a full-time student, they have obtained a degree, diploma, certificate, or trade or apprenticeship credential following the completion of a post-secondary education program of at least 2 years from a recognized [publicly funded institution](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/post-secondary-institutions.html) in 1 of the 4 Atlantic provinces (New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia or Newfoundland and Labrador)\n* that they resided in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador or Prince Edward Island for at least 16 months (cumulative) within the 24-month period before their credential was granted\n* that they maintained valid temporary resident status throughout their stay in Canada and had authorization for any work, study or training they engaged in while in Canada\n\n#### Eligible educational credentials\n\nOnly certain educational credentials are eligible for the Atlantic International Graduate Program.
