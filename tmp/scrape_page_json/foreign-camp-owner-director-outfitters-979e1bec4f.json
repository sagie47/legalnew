nationals involved with outfitting operations in which no fees are charged do not require work permits and may be admitted as tourist visitors.\n\n**Business visitors**– Foreign national owners of outfitting operations with paying clientele may be admitted as business visitors (tour operators or guides) if they are accompanying the clientele from outside Canada and if there is little in the way of services being provided to the clientele while in Canada. For example, the foreign national is not preparing meals or providing guiding services but is assisting with any problems the clientele may encounter after arriving at the destination.\n\nA foreign national owner of an outfitting operation in which fees are charged is eligible for an LMIA-exempt work permit if the business is able to satisfy the requirement of significant benefit to Canada.\n\nRecognizing that many outfitting operations are owned jointly by individuals with equal shares of a fishing or hunting operation (for example, 5 owners, each with 20% ownership), IRCC**is allowing the C11 exemption for each of these owners** if the business is able to satisfy the requirement of significant benefit to Canada.\n\nOther owners (for example, owners with a lesser share) in this category must apply for a work permit as employees and thus require an LMIA if they are conducting “[work](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/what-is-work.html)”.\n\nDocumentary evidence\n--------------------\n\nRequirements for fishing and hunting outfitters vary by province (for example, there is a yearly licence for commercial outfitters in Saskatchewan). In conducting their review of the camp/outfitting or fishing operation, officers should request and review the relevant licences or registration documents that the foreign national has obtained.\n\nSupporting documents may include income and expenditures, rental or lease agreements for the land, and a business plan and ownership documents.\n\nApplication assessment\n----------------------\n\nA key step for officers is to identity the essential elements of the camp/outfitting or fishing operation: ownership, share of ownership, other foreign nationals and Canadians involved with the operation (namely guides and employees), the services provided by the operation, fees charged, Canadian goods and services being used, etc. It is also necessary to determine whether “[work](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/what-is-work.html)” is occurring.\n\nFor the assessment of foreign nationals entering Canada where the officer assesses that the foreign national does not qualify as either a tourist or a business visitor and is involved to some degree with any fishing or hunting outfitting operation or is working as a camp/outfitter in the province, the information below may assist in decision-making:\n\n* **Sole owner or majority owner (and spouses)**\n * Eligible for an LMIA-exempt work permit under C11 if the officer is satisfied that significant benefit to Canada is substantiated\n\n* **Owner with equal share (and spouses)**\n * Eligible for an LMIA-exempt work permit under C11 if the officer is satisfied that significant benefit to Canada is substantiated\n\n* **Other owner (that is, not a majority owner or an equal owner)**\n * Requires an LMIA and a work permit as an employee if carrying out “[work](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/what-is-work.html)”\n\n* **Non-owner (including guides)**\n * See [Fishing guides](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/unique-situations/fishing-guides.html)\n\nSignificant benefit for these typically small, seasonal outfitting operations can be assessed based on the following:\n\n* amount of income brought into and remaining in Canada (meaning any amounts charged to foreign “guests” or clientele that directly cover the costs associated with the trip)\n* amount spent on goods and services in Canada or wages to Canadians or permanent residents\n* assessment of general economic stimulus, meaning development or job creation\n* assessment of whether or not the outfitter is impinging on other Canadian service providers. For example, are other Canadian outfitters in the area losing business directly because of this outfitter’s operation? An officer could consult with the provincial or territorial tourism authority (or outfitting association, if applicable) for their opinion. An officer might also suggest that the outfitter obtain a letter from a local chamber of commerce attesting to their business’s economical benefit to the region, or advise them to obtain one for next entry.\n\n**Note:** Given the seasonal and part-time nature of these operations, their threshold of significant benefit tends to be lower than an assessment of significant benefit for other exemptions under **paragraph R205(a)**.\n\nGenuine relationship\n--------------------\n\nIn accordance with [section R4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-4.html), a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse or a common-law partner of a person if the marriage or common-law partnership either\n\n* was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the IRPA, or\n* is not genuine.\n\nIf officers have concerns as to the genuineness of the relationship, to be procedurally fair, they should request further documentation or information to confirm that the relationship between the dependent spouse and the principal foreign national is genuine and is not a relationship of convenience. Procedural fairness means giving the applicant the opportunity to respond to the officer’s concerns prior to any decision.\n\nIf the officer believes that the applicant has misrepresented themselves, the officer should follow the instructions for proceeding with a determination.\n\nFinal decision\n--------------\n\nFor detailed instructions, please review [Business owners seeking only temporary residence– [R205(a)– C11]– International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/entrepreneurs-self-employed-seeking-only-temp-residence-r205-c11.html#s13).\n\nFamily members\n--------------\n\nThe spouses of foreign national owners whose application for an LMIA-exempt work permit under administrative code C11 is approved may also obtain such work permits if they are otherwise admissible to Canada.\n\nRelated links\n-------------\n\n* [Significant benefit – General guidelines (C10)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/canadian-interests-significant-benefit-general-guidelines-r205-c10.html)\n* [Business owners seeking only temporary residence– [R205(a)– C11]– International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/entrepreneurs-self-employed-seeking-only-temp-residence-r205-c11.html)\n\nPrevious updates\n----------------\n\n2014-12-18\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2025-12-09",
