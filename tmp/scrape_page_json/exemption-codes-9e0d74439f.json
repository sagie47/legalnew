  "text": "Published Time: Wed, 11 Feb 2026 23:47:08 GMT\n\nLabour market impact assessment (LMIA) exemption codes – International Mobility Program(IMP)\n============================================================================================\n\nThis section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nSections 204 to 208 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) provide the regulatory authority to issue a work permit to a worker who does not require a labour market impact assessment (LMIA) as per [subparagraphs R200(1)(c)(i) to (ii.1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html).\n\nThere are specific situations that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) considers, by policy, as meeting the requirements of sections R204 through R208. In doing so, the department has created LMIA exemption streams (via unique administrative codes) to identify the different eligibilities or criteria for those specific situations. Meeting the eligibility criteria to be assessed under a LMIA-exemption category only means the applicant does not require a LMIA for their application to be processed. The officer must still be satisfied that all regulatory requirements are met for the issuance of a work permit, including all relevant factors of section R200.\n\nThe LMIA exemption codes are listed in the following tables.\n\n**Important:** There were several code changes and new codes added on December 15, 2022. Officers should ensure that they are using the correct coding based on the specific work permit category instructions.\n\nLegislative sections\n--------------------\n\n* [A25.2 Public policies](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#a25)\n* [R204: Agreements or arrangements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#r204)\n* [R205: Canadian interests](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#r205)\n* [R206: No other means of support](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#r206)\n* [R207: Permanent residence applicants in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#r207)\n* [R207.1: Vulnerable workers](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#r207.1)\n* [R208: Humanitarian reasons](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#r208)\n* [International Mobility Workers Unit (IMWU): Port of entry (POE) assistance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#imwu)\n\nA25.2: Public policies\n----------------------\n\n| Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) | LMIA exemption code (December 14 and before) | LMIA exemption code (December 15, 2022, and after) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public policies issued under A25.2 (inside Canada): * [Open work permits for Hong Kong recent graduates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/open-work-permit-graduate-hong-kong.html) * [Optional open work permits for permanent residence pathways for Hong Kong residents](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/open-work-pathways-hong-kong.html) * [Open work permits for foreign nationals with a support letter from a province or territory](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/open-work-permits-province-territory.html) Instructions for special measures in response to global events can be found under [Service delivery– Special measures](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery.html).

It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nSections 204 to 208 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) provide the regulatory authority to issue a work permit to a worker who does not require a labour market impact assessment (LMIA) as per [subparagraphs R200(1)(c)(i) to (ii.1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html).\n\nThere are specific situations that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) considers, by policy, as meeting the requirements of sections R204 through R208. In doing so, the department has created LMIA exemption streams (via unique administrative codes) to identify the different eligibilities or criteria for those specific situations. Meeting the eligibility criteria to be assessed under a LMIA-exemption category only means the applicant does not require a LMIA for their application to be processed. The officer must still be satisfied that all regulatory requirements are met for the issuance of a work permit, including all relevant factors of section R200.\n\nThe LMIA exemption codes are listed in the following tables.\n\n**Important:** There were several code changes and new codes added on December 15, 2022. Officers should ensure that they are using the correct coding based on the specific work permit category instructions.\n\nLegislative sections\n--------------------\n\n* [A25.2 Public policies](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#a25)\n* [R204: Agreements or arrangements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#r204)\n* [R205: Canadian interests](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#r205)\n* [R206: No other means of support](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#r206)\n* [R207: Permanent residence applicants in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#r207)\n* [R207.1: Vulnerable workers](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#r207.1)\n* [R208: Humanitarian reasons](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#r208)\n* [International Mobility Workers Unit (IMWU): Port of entry (POE) assistance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html#imwu)\n\nA25.2: Public policies\n----------------------\n\n| Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) | LMIA exemption code (December 14 and before) | LMIA exemption code (December 15, 2022, and after) |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Public policies issued under A25.2 (inside Canada): * [Open work permits for Hong Kong recent graduates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/open-work-permit-graduate-hong-kong.html) * [Optional open work permits for permanent residence pathways for Hong Kong residents](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/open-work-pathways-hong-kong.html) * [Open work permits for foreign nationals with a support letter from a province or territory](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/open-work-permits-province-territory.html) Instructions for special measures in response to global events can be found under [Service delivery– Special measures](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery.html).
