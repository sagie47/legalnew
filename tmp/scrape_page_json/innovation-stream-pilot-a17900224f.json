An offer of employment at or above $27 per hour in Ontario would be considered a high wage.\n\n**Median hourly wage by occupation and location (Job Bank)**\n\nThe [median hourly wage](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/marketreport/wages-occupation/993/geo29307) is for an occupation in a specific location.\n\nFor example, the median wage for a registered nurse (NOC 31303) in Toronto is $38.05 per hour, whereas the median wage for the occupation in Ottawa is $41.00 per hour. ESDC updates median wages on Job Bank annually in the fall.\n\n**Employer wage range**\n\nThis is the wage offered by an employer within the same range as current employees hired for the same job, in the same location, with similar skills and work experience.\n\n**Prevailing wage**\n\nThe prevailing [wage](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/median-wage/high/requirements.html#h2.10) is the highest of either the **median hourly wage on Job Bank** or the **employer wage range**.\n\n**Collective bargaining agreement (CBA)**\n\nThe CBA is a legal contract between an employer and a labour union representing the employees.\n\nEligibility\n-----------\n\nTo be eligible under paragraph R205(c)(ii), administrative code C88, at the time of the decision on the work permit application, foreign nationals must meet all general eligibility requirements for a work permit and all the following requirements:\n\n* If applying before entry under R197, or after entry under R198, applicants must submit their work permit application online through the IRCC Secure Account (or through the Authorized Paid Representatives Portal) unless they are exempt from the mandatory electronic application (e-application) requirement for temporary residents.\n* Applicants must have obtained an offer of employment number (A#) from one of the employers selected for Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada’s (ISED) Global Hypergrowth Project (GHP).\n* Applicants must have an offer of employment in a TEER 0, 1, 2 or 3 occupation, which offers wages that meet the following criteria of both tests:\n * first, must be at or above the [median hourly wages by province or territory](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/service-tables.html#h2.2) (if this is **not** met, there is no need to assess the second wage test)\n * second, meet the requirements of the applicable collective bargaining agreement\n\n* If the position is not under a collective bargaining agreement, the wage offered must be **at**or **above** the prevailing wage that is defined as the highest of either:\n 1. at or above the regional **median hourly wage (or salary) for the occupation** posted on [Job Bank’s Wage Report](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/trend-analysis/search-wages)\n * If the median wage is listed as “n/a”, the provincial or territorial wage should be used. If not available, the national wage would apply.\n\nor\n\n 2. within the wage range paid to current employees hired for the same job and work location, and with the same skills and years of experience.\n\n* **Wage review:**The offer must also indicate that the employer will review wages on the first day of work and then annually by January 1 to ensure that the wages remain prevailing throughout the employment period. This includes the following:\n * on the first day of work and then annually thereafter, a review and increase, if required, of wages offered for alignment with the prevailing wages as defined on IRCC website, if required\n * an alignment of the wage with [Job Bank](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/trend-analysis/search-wages) updates or any increases to wages offered to current employees hired for the same job, work location, skills and years or experience\n\n* Pursuant to paragraph[R200(3)(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html), officers must be satisfied that applicants have the ability to perform the work that is sought, and should therefore consider whether applicants have the required education and experience outlined in the employment requirements section of the [National Occupational Classification](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/)for the occupation offered.\n* Applicants who are in Canada at the time of submission must\n * have valid temporary resident status or\n * be eligible for restoration of status as a temporary resident\n\n and\n * be eligible to apply for a work permit from within Canada [section[R199](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-199.html) or a public policy that is in effect at the time of application]\n\n**Who is not eligible under the Innovation Stream**\n\n* Foreign nationals who do not meet the eligibility criteria outlined above are not eligible for this stream and would be required to apply for an LMIA-based work permit unless they qualify under another LMIA-exemption category.\n\nDocumentary evidence\n--------------------\n\nOfficers should be satisfied that they have the following documentary evidence to make an assessment\n\n1. proof that the employer is on the list of employers who are participating in the GHP\n * Officers must confirm this information on the Offer of Employment.\n\n2. proof that the employer meets the wage requirements\n3. proof that the applicant meets the job requirement\n * Applicants must have a job offer in a TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3 occupation and meet the required education and experience listed in the employment requirements section of the [National Occupational Classification (NOC)](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/?GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA) for the intended occupation.\n\nApplication assessment\n----------------------\n\nOfficers must be satisfied that **all** eligibility requirements are**met at the time of decision** on a work permit application.\n\nWhen assessing applications in this category, officers must determine if the applicant can perform the work sought in Canada.\n\nWhen assessing whether the applicant meets the requirements of the occupation they are applying for, officers should review the offer of employment that appears under the Employment Details tab in the Global Case Management System (GCMS) for information provided by the employer or the matching fields on the IMM 5802 form (if the employer was authorized to use it).\n\n| Field | Officers should consider the following information |\n| --- | --- |\n| LMIA Exemption Code | C88 – the employer should have selected this code. Ensure that the requirements under the exemption code match the description in “Requirements Exemptions met.” |\n| Requirements Exemptions Met | Information in this field should outline that all the requirements are met. Please note that evidence to corroborate how the employer and applicant meet the LMIA-exemption category requirements may be included in supporting documents to the offer. |\n| Duties | Activities that the foreign national will be performing. They must align with the occupation and duties described in the[National Occupational Classification](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/). |\n\n### Wage assessment\n\nEmployers are provided with instructions on how to meet the wage requirement.\n\nWages stated in the offer must meet both tests:\n\n**First test:**\n\nThe wage offered must meet the provincial or territorial median hourly wage, as specified on [Employment and Social Development Canada’s website](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/median-wage.html).\n\nEmployment offers below these rates **require a labour market impact assessment (LMIA)**.\n\nCollective bargaining agreement wages do not supersede the requirement to have wages offered that are equal to or higher than the provincial or territorial median hourly wage.\n\nIf the first test is not met (i.e., the provincial and territorial median hourly wage), officers do not need to assess the second test.\n\n**Second test**\n\nThe wage offered must meet the requirements of the applicable collective bargaining agreement (CBA) for unionized workers.\n\n**Proof:**The employer can include information about meeting the second test in the “Additional information” text box of the offer of employment and upload a copy of the collective bargaining agreement with their offer of employment when they submit it in the Employer Portal.\n\n**or**\n\nIf the foreign workers are **not** subject to a CBA, the employer must meet the following criteria:\n\nThe wage offered must **be at or above** the wage that is the highest of either:\n\n* a. the regional **median hourly wage (or salary) for the occupation** posted on [Job Bank’s Wage Report](https://www.jobbank.gc.ca/trend-analysis/search-wages)\n * If the median wage is listed as “n/a”, consult the provincial or territorial wage. If it is not available, consult the national wage.\n\nOr\n\n* b. the wage that is within the wage range that the employer is paying their current employees hired for the same job and work location, and with the same skills and years of experience\n\n**Proof:** Employers are required to include the actual wage in the section titled “Wage and benefits” in the offer of employment. Information about meeting this requirement may be found in the “Additional information” text box.\n\nThe officers will need to confirm if the employer has included information in the offer of employment in the “Additional information” text box confirming that the employer will review wages on the first day of work and then annually by January 1 to ensure that the wages prevail throughout the employment period.\n\nThe wage range should be from the last 2 pay periods that have occurred within the 6 weeks before submitting the offer of employment.\n\n1. If the position requires additional skills and years of experience over the applicable NOC description, the wages offered should reflect these additional requirements.\n\nTo determine the wage rate being offered, officers will only consider guaranteed wages, which exclude\n\n1. overtime hours\n2. tips\n3. benefits\n4. profit sharing\n5. bonuses\n6. commissions\n7. other forms of compensation (e.g., piece work, which is work that is paid at a fixed rate based on the amount done rather than the time it takes to do the job).\n\n**Note:**If the first test is not met (i.e., the provincial and territorial median hourly wage), officers do not need to assess the second test (i.e., the prevailing wage). Note that not all applicants will be subject to collective agreements.\n\nFinal decision\n--------------\n\n### Approvals\n\nOn the Application screen, officers should enter the following information in the specified fields:\n\n| Field | Selection or input |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case type | 52 * The Case type field must be “52.” No other case type will allow the correct linkage in GCMS. Entering a case type other than “52” will result in incorrect accounting for GCMS, requiring manual corrections to be made and making inspection activities more difficult. |\n| Province of destination | Address of physical job location * If there is more than one location, enter the main location in this field and the secondary location in Remarks. |\n| City of destination | Address of physical job location * If there is more than one location, enter the main location in this field and the secondary location in Remarks. |\n| LMIA Exemption code | C88 |\n| NOC | National Occupational Classification code The NOC code will auto-populate when the work permit is properly matched with the offer of employment. |\n| Intended occupation | Job title The job title will auto-populate when the work permit is properly matched with the offer of employment. |\n| Salary (CAD) | Enter the “amount per year,” as indicated in the offer of employment (the temporary worker’s wage in Canadian dollars and number of working hours). |\n| Duration | The work permit may be issued for up to 5 years, or until the expiry of the passport or job offer, whichever comes first. Extensions may be permitted before the expiry of this stream on March 22, 2026. |\n| Fees | Work permit processing fee – $155 |\n| Biometrics | Work permit applicants are required to provide biometric information and pay the biometric fee ($85). The regular biometric exemptions apply (for example, under 14 or 1 in 10 rule). |\n\n### Refusals\n\nIf an officer has determined that the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements, they should record their reasons for decision as per the instructions in:[Decision making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html).\n\nOpen work permits for family members\n------------------------------------\n\nFamily members of high-skilled workers are eligible to apply for an open work permit under subparagraph R205(c)(ii). Refer to\n\n* [Family members of foreign nationals authorized to work in high-skilled occupations (TEER 0, 1, 2 or 3) [R205(c)(ii) – C41 and C46]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c41-c46.html)\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2024-12-24",
