It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nIn these instructions “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).\n\nThe instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with\n\n* [Employer-specific work permits with Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) exemptions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html)\n* [Conditions and validity period on work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html)\n* [Public list of Employers who have been non-compliant](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/public-list-employers-who-have-been-non-compliant.html)\n\nIn this situation, “province” legally refers to provinces and territories. Therefore, in these instructions, when “province” is used, it refers to both provinces and territories.\n\nAn Exceptional and Unforeseen Event is defined as a temporary situation during or following an event that poses a significant risk to people’s lives, health, general safety, property or the environment. For instance, one such event could be an earthquake.\n\nIRCC is responsible for assessing proposals or requests under the agreements for exceptional and unforeseen events from provinces in accordance with the criteria outlined in their respective foreign worker agreement or annex. The proposals or requests are **event-based** and, as such, will vary in duration and from one jurisdiction to another.\n\nThe Exceptional and Unforeseen Events provision allows provinces to provide a letter of support for the issuance of a work permit that would otherwise not be covered under existing LMIA exemptions or work permit exemptions in the Immigration Refugee Protection Regulations.\n\n[Emergency service providers](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/authorization-work-without-work-permit-emergency-service-providers.html), including medical service personnel, who meet the requirements of a work permit exemption under [R186(t)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) can enter Canada for the purpose of providing services in times of emergency (such as natural disasters).\n\nProvincial proposals for LMIA exemptions under the Exceptional and Unforeseen Events provisions **must be approved by IRCC**. Once they are approved, the province or territory will provide the applicant with the LMIA exemption support letter.\n\nOn this page\n------------\n\n* [General eligibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/federal-provincial-territorial-agreements-r204-lmia-exemption-code-t13/exceptional-unforeseen-events.html#general-eligibility)\n* [Documentary evidence](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/federal-provincial-territorial-agreements-r204-lmia-exemption-code-t13/exceptional-unforeseen-events.html#documentary-evidence)\n* [Work permit issuance in the Global Case Management System (GCMS)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/federal-provincial-territorial-agreements-r204-lmia-exemption-code-t13/exceptional-unforeseen-events.html#work-permit-issuance)\n\nGeneral eligibility\n-------------------\n\nThere are presently no approved situations under the Exceptional and Unforeseen Events sections in the Federal-Provincial Agreements.\n\nDocumentary evidence\n--------------------\n\nThe following are required before a work permit application can be approved:\n\n* a provincial letter of support containing details such as \n * the full name and date of birth of the individual selected\n * information about the employer \n * name of employer\n * occupation \n * duration of employment\n\n* an LMIA-exempt offer of employment submitted in the Employer Portal (A#######) or through an **approved**[alternate submission](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html#t4) of the IMM 5802 form \n * Including a proof of employer compliance fee payment (such as the receipt number) unless an alternate submission was approved and the employer is exempt.\n\n**Note:** Foreign nationals seeking to enter Canada under a provincial or territorial agreement pursuant to section R204(c) are still required to meet all other requirements under the Immigration Refugee Protection Act and the Immigration Refugee Protection Regulations.\n\nWork permit issuance in the Global Case Management System (GCMS)\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGiven the time-sensitive nature of the LMIA-exempt work permits required in relation to Exceptional and Unforeseen Events, officers are instructed to process work permit applications on an urgent basis.\n\nUnder the Application screen for employer-specific work permits, enter the information below.\n\n| Field | Selection or input |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case type | 52– Employer-specific LMIA-exempt applications * The Case type field must indicate “52” if there is an offer of employment in the Employer Portal.
