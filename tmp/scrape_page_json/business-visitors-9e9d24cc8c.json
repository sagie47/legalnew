This may require demonstrating certain procedures. The demonstration must not result in the completion of an [installation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#i1) or servicing task, or of part of such task, or in the productive operation of the equipment or machinery.\n\nThe CCOFTA **does not** relieve after-sales or after-lease service personnel, or any other business person, from the obligation to comply with municipal, regional, provincial/territorial, or other federal requirements where these apply.\n\n#### Work that does not meet the eligibility requirements of after-sales or after-lease service\n\nPersons whose activities or services in Canada would constitute hands-on building and construction work may **not** enter under [R186(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) and the CCOFTA as after-sales or after-lease service.\n\nGenerally, the entry of foreign tradespersons in the building and construction industry is subject to an assessment of the availability of domestic labour (an LMIA). As part of the LMIA process, Service Canada will consult with organized labour prior to making a determination.\n\nFor personnel performing the installation or servicing, entry should not be granted when performing hands-on building and construction work. The performance of these activities are not permitted, regardless of wording in sales, warranty or service agreements supporting they be completed.\n\n**Building and construction work:** includes installing, maintaining, and repairing utility services, any part of the fabric of any building or structure, or machinery, equipment, or structures within a building.\n\nBuilding and construction work includes activities normally performed by (but not limited to):\n\n* labourers;\n* millwrights;\n* heat and frost insulators;\n* bricklayers;\n* carpenters and joiners;\n* electrical workers;\n* operating engineers (includes heavy equipment operators);\n* elevator constructors;\n* sheet metal workers;\n* teamsters;\n* boilermakers;\n* residential, commercial, or industrial painters (including the application of all service coatings no matter how applied);\n* bridge, structural, and ornamental ironworkers;\n* plumbers and pipefitters;\n* roofers;\n* plasterers and cement masons.\n\nBuilding and construction work includes work involving:\n\n* assembly lines;\n* conveyor belts and systems;\n* overhead cranes;\n* heating, cooling, and ventilation or exhaust systems;\n* elevators and escalators;\n* boilers and turbines; and\n* dismantling or demolition of commercial or industrial equipment or machinery, whether on-site or in-plant.\n\nDocumentary evidence\n--------------------\n\nUnder [Annex 1203](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/colombia-colombie/fta-ale/12.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=establish%20permanent%20residence.-,Annex%201203,-Temporary%20Entry%20For) of the CCOFTA, a business visitor must provide the following documentation:\n\n* proof of Colombian citizenship, nationality or permanent residency status;\n* documentation demonstrating that the business person will be engaged in a business activity set out in Appendix 1203.A.1 of the CCOFTA and describing the purpose of entry; and\n* evidence that the business activity is international in scope and that the they are not attempting to enter the Canadian labour market. \n * the primary source of remuneration is outside Canada, and\n * the person’s place of business remains outside Canada and the profits of the business are accumulated primarily outside Canada.\n\nOral declaration as to the principal place of business and the actual place of accrual of profits can be used as documentary evidence. If further proof is requested, a letter from the employer or the representing organization is sufficient. Prior approval procedures, labour certification tests, or other similar procedures cannot be required. Every effort should be made to avoid the requirement of a visa.\n\nIn general, an individual who is to be paid in Canada would be considered to be joining the labour market and could not be authorized to enter Canada as a business visitor. The payment of expenses incidental to the trip is allowed, as is an honorarium.\n\n### Documentary evidence for after-sales or after-lease service\n\nBusiness visitors applying under the after-sales or after-lease service provision of [Appendix 1203.A](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/colombia-colombie/fta-ale/12.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=of%20the%20requirement.-,Appendix%201203.A,-Business%20Visitors) of the CCOFTA should be referred for a secondary examination when seeking entry, due to the complexity of the application and for reasons of client service and program consistency.\n\nThe following documentation is required:\n\n* proof of Colombian citizenship, nationality or permanent residency; and\n* copies of the original sales or lease agreement, and warranty or service agreement, including extensions, which clearly support the purpose of entry.\n\nThe warranty or service contract must be incidental to, or connected to the sale or lease of commercial or industrial equipment or machinery, including computer software.\n\nThe warranty or service agreement does not need to have the same date as the sales or lease agreement. Particularly with third party service as it may take a number of months after the sale before the company installing or servicing the machinery is identified and sub-contracted.\n\nThe initial warranty or service agreement may be extended provided that the sales or lease agreement, or initial warranty or service agreement contained a provision allowing for the extension. The after-sales or after-lease service, therefore, continues to be contracted as part of the sale or lease of the equipment or machinery, or computer software.\n\n### Third party service\n\nIf [third party service](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#t3) occurs, there must be clear wording in the sales or lease agreement that specifies a third party will perform the installation, warranty, or service work. Unless such wording exists, there is no evidence that the third party service is incidental to the sale or lease. However, the firm need not be named in the agreement, as it may take some time for the firm to be identified. When a third party is not named in the sales or lease agreement, business visitors may be expected to provide a letter from the seller of the equipment that identifies them as the third party referenced in the original sales or lease agreement.\n\nWhen a seller or lessor located in the Colombian contracts the after-sales or after-lease servicing to a third party, the third party must also be established in Colombia.\n\n### Lack of Documentation\n\nEvery effort should be made to allow documentation to be provided (e.g., by fax, email or verbal explanation) from the company in Canada or the business visitor’s employer in Colombia.\n\nThe requirement for documentation has been imposed in order to clearly establish that the proposed activity is incidental or connected to the sale or lease of the equipment or machinery or computer software.\n\nA verbal statement that the business of the applicant is being carried on outside Canada can be acceptable. Alternative indications (business cards, business papers, advertising pamphlets, etc.) may be helpful.\n\nFinal decision\n--------------\n\n### Visitor record\n\nA business visitor’s stay in Canada will usually be short-term (6 months or less).\n\nIt is recommended that border services officers consider issuing a [visitor record](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/visitor-record.html) to a business visitor engaged in ‘after-sales or after-lease service’ work for a period of longer than 6 months and indicate in the “Remarks” section why a longer period of time is being granted.\n\nThese visits may take place over a period of weeks or months. In these circumstances, border services officers should consider issuing a visitor record to reduce potential referrals on future entries.\n\nApplications for extension of status should be determined based on whether the foreign national remains eligible.\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2024-10-03",
