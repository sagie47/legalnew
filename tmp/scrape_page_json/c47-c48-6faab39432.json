It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nImportant:\n----------\n\nThese instructions apply to:\n\n* applications for work permits received by IRCC on or before January 21, 2025, 04:59:59 A.M. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) from family members of foreign nationals authorized to work in low-skilled occupations (TEER 4 or 5).\n* **For in-Canada applicants only:** applications to renew work authorizations received by IRCC on or after January 21, 2025, 05:00:00 A.M. UTC from family members of low-skilled workers authorized to work in low-skilled occupations (TEER 4 or 5), where the requested duration aligns with the principal foreign national’s existing work authorization. For example: the family members received a shorter work permit validity due to their passport validity and they wish to renew their work permit after they received a new passport.\n* applications received from family members of low-skilled workers authorized to work or approved for a work permit **and** are transitioning to permanent residence. If the principal foreign national holds a work permit under certain IMP streams, the applicant need **not** demonstrate that an application for permanent residence has been submitted:\n\n Example of categories of applicants transitioning for permanent residence: \n * Specific Quebec Selection Certificate (CSQ) holders currently in Quebec [[R205(a) – A73](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/quebec-cases/labour-market-impact-assessment-exempt-work-permit-renewals-extensions-certain-quebec-selection-holders.html)]\n * Foreign nationals nominated by a province – Provincial agreements [[R204(c) – T13](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/federal-provincial-territorial-agreements-r204-lmia-exemption-code-t13/nominated-by-province.html)]\n * Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP) [[R204(c) – C18](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/special-initiatives-pilot-project/exemption-code-c18.html)]\n * Yukon Community Pilot – Open work permits [[R205(a) – A75](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/special-initiatives-pilot-project/yukon-exemption-code-a75.html)]\n * Family members of principal applicants under the [Agri-Food Pilot](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/agri-food.html) continue to be eligible to apply for an open work permit under C47/C48 if the principal applicant holds an LMIA-based work permit in the agriculture or low-wage stream or is approved for such a work permit and the principal foreign national **received an acknowledgment of receipt letter from IRCC** to confirm that their application for permanent residence is complete.\n\n* The principal foreign worker in the above categories must be transitioning to permanent residence and be authorized or provisionally approved (i.e., the letter of introduction was issued) to work in Canada for a period of at **least 6 months** or longer after the receipt date of the family member’s open work permit (OWP) application.\n* For applications received on or after January 21, 2025, 05:00 A.M, the principal foreign worker is not transitioning to permanent residence (i.e., the principal applicant is not part of the above listed categories), their family members are no longer eligible to apply for an open work permit under the IMP categories C47 or C48.\n\nIn these instructions, “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).\n\nThe instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with the following:\n\n* [Open work permit – General processing and issuance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html)\n* [Conditions and validity period on work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html)\n\nLow-skilled occupations are considered to be those in the National Occupational Classification (NOC), Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER) categories 4 and 5.\n\nA dependent child is either a biological child or an adopted child of a parent [[R2(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/page-2.html#h-685476)].

application. \n * For example, if the open work permit application was submitted on March 1, 2024, the principal foreign national’s work authorization must be valid until September 1, 2024 (6 months).\n\n* be **employed** or will be employed in a low-skilled occupation ([TEER 4 or 5](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/Structure/Matrix)) (see [Note](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c47-c48.html#s0))\n* if authorized to work by the issuance of a work permit, have a permit **that has not been issued** based on a labour market impact assessment (LMIA) in the \n * Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program (SAWP)\n * agricultural stream\n * low-wage stream\n\n**Exceptions**\n\nFamily members of principal applicants under the Agri-Food Pilot are eligible to apply for an open work permit under C47/C48 if\n\n * the principal applicant holds an LMIA-based work permit in the agriculture or low-wage stream or is approved for such a work permit\n * the principal applicant received an acknowledgment of receipt letter from IRCC to confirm that their application for permanent residence is complete\n\n**Note:** Family members of principal applicants under the Agri-Food Pilot are eligible to apply for an open work permit under C49 if the principal applicant holds a [bridging open work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/provincial-nominees-permanent-resident-applicants/bridging-open-work-permits.html) or is approved for one.\n\n**Note:** Family members of work permit applicants or holders do not have a field in the application form to indicate for which category code (C41/C46 or C47/C48) they are applying. If the applicant indicated in their application that they are a family member of a worker, **the officer must enter the correct category code** that relates to the proof provided in their application that shows the skill level of the principal applicant.\n\nOfficers should not be refusing applications because the code the applicant provided in their documentary evidence is incorrect. The open work permit applicant is not responsible for selecting the correct administrative code; that is the responsibility of IRCC.\n\n* be physically residing or plan to physically reside in Canada while employed\n* be in one of the following situations: \n * be in a [genuine relationship](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c47-c48.html#genuine-relationship) with the applicant as a spouse or common-law partner\n * be the parent of the applicant who is a family member as defined in R1(3)(b) or (c). \n\nApplicants who are in Canada at the time of submission must\n\n* have valid temporary resident status (including being on maintained status under [R183(5)](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-183.html)) or be eligible for restoration of status as a temporary resident\n* be eligible to apply for a work permit from within Canada [R199]\n\nOfficers can assess the TEER category of the principal foreign national using the NOC 2021 version of the [NOC matrix](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/Structure/Matrix/000e9b8170d945b7a7b6e0ecd4625357). Given that dependent family members of low-skilled workers were not eligible to apply until after November 16, 2021, NOC 2021 will be the only version used to assess the level of the principal foreign nationals occupation.\n\nOfficers can confirm the LMIA stream by reviewing the LMIA approval letter or the notation in the Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) “Comments” field in the Global Case Management System (GCMS).\n\n| LMIA program title | Abbreviation |\n| --- | --- |\n| Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program Programme des travailleurs agricoles saisonniers | SAWP PTAS |\n| Agricultural Stream Volet agricoles | Ag Ag |\n| Low-wage position Poste à bas salaire | L-W B-S |\n| High-wage position Poste à haute salaire | H-W H-S |\n| Permanent resident Résident permanent | PR RP |\n\nDocumentary evidence\n--------------------\n\nWith the application for an open work permit, officers should be satisfied that they have the following documentary evidence to make an assessment:\n\n1. evidence of a genuine relationship if the applicant is the spouse or common-law partner \n * For example (but not limited to), marriage certificate, Statutory Declaration of Common-Law Union [IMM 5409],\n\n**or**\n\n evidence that the dependent child meets the definition of section R2\n * For example, but not limited to, birth certificate, adoption papers.\n\n2. evidence that the principal foreign national is or **will be employed in**, in TEER category 4 or 5 occupation \n * For example, job contract, letter from employer indicating NOC TEER category and duties.\n\n**Note:** Where family members provide the documentary evidence, but the specific NOC code is not indicated, **then the officers should identify the NOC TEER category** from the job title and duties. The officers should not refuse the work permit application simply because the NOC code was not included in the documentary evidence.\n\n3. evidence that the principal foreign national **is** authorized or is provisionally approved to work in Canada and the authorization is not within the exceptions stated in [Eligibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c47-c48.html#eligibility)\n * For example, copy of work permit or copy of visitor record indicating work under section R186, or passport stamps showing period of authorized stay, evidence that their principal foreign national has been provisionally approved for a work permit (that the letter of introduction is issued).\n\n4. evidence that the principal foreign national’s authority or provisional approval to work in Canada is valid for 6 months or longer **after** the receipt date of the family member’s work permit application \n * For example, a copy of a work permit or passport stamps showing the period of authorized work (for work-permit exempt foreign nationals) or a copy of the letter of introduction.\n\n5. if the principal foreign national’s work permit was issued based on an LMIA, evidence that the LMIA was not in the following streams: \n * SAWP\n * agricultural stream\n * low-wage stream\n\n**Exception:** Family members of principal applicants under the Agri-Food Pilot must provide a copy of the acknowledgement of receipt letter that the Agri-Food Pilot principal applicant received from IRCC. This letter confirms that their application for permanent residence is complete.\n\n**Note:** The principal foreign national may be on authorized leave from their employer and still be considered “employed”. For example, if the principal foreign national is on maternity leave and is expected to return to work for the same employer, they may be considered employed.\n\nPrincipal foreign national is open work permit holder or work permit exempt\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf the principal foreign national is an open work permit holder or is authorized to work without a permit under section R186 and the authorization is not within the exceptions stated in [Eligibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c47-c48.html#eligibility), the occupation skill level cannot be determined solely by means of the work permit or visitor record. The occupation skill level of the principal applicant is required to ensure that the correct administrative code and eligibility criteria are assessed.\n\nTherefore, the family member applicant must also provide the following:\n\n* a letter from the principal foreign national’s current Canadian employer confirming employment and their occupation as well as the NOC, with a description of duties or a copy of their employment offer or contract\n* evidence that the principal foreign national is employed in a TEER category 4 or 5 occupation at the time of the family member’s work permit application submission **until a decision on the application is rendered**\n\n**Important:** If the principal foreign national has been selected by Quebec or nominated by another province or territory, and has been approved for an employer-specific work permit, but has **not yet applied** for permanent residence, their family members should be assessed under the eligibility criteria based on the occupation the principal foreign national is employed in.\n\n* The only exception to this is principal foreign nationals who hold an open work permit or are approved for an open work permit under the administrative [code A76](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/quebec-cases/csq-outside-quebec.html) (Quebec Selection Certificate [CSQ] holders outside Quebec), as they are not required to be employed; if the principal foreign national is not employed, officers should use the code C41 or C46 for family member applications.\n\nApplications received as a family group\n---------------------------------------\n\nIf the family members and the principal foreign national are applying together as a family group, the principal foreign national’s application must be assessed first. The principal family members’ application in the group may be considered as **documentary evidence** of the authority or provisional approval to work in Canada, the occupational level and the requirement of a 6-month duration.\n\n### Family groups outside Canada\n\nThere are several different situations where applicants for an open work permit may be applying with their principal foreign national.\n\n#### Principal foreign national is a work permit applicant\n\nThe principal foreign national’s application is assessed **first** before the rest of the family.\n\nIf the principal foreign national is eligible and admissible, the dependent family members are assessed for eligibility and admissibility. When they all receive a positive assessment, the officer will enter the [final decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c47-c48.html#decision) in GCMS.\n\nIf the principal foreign national’s work permit application is refused, the work permit applications of their family members will be refused for not meeting the requirements of this category.\n\nIf the family group is approved, the principal foreign national must enter Canada either before or with their family members. The dependent family member cannot arrive in Canada prior to the entry of the principal foreign national.\n\n#### Principal foreign national is work-permit exempt, temporary resident visa (TRV) applicant and family members are TRV-required\n\nIf the dependent family members and the principal foreign national are TRV-required, the dependent family members are not eligible to apply for an open work permit before entry.\n\nForeign nationals are not authorized to work without a work permit under section R186 until they have entered Canada. Therefore, family members of a principal foreign national who is applying for a TRV to enter Canada to work without a work permit under section R186 do not meet the eligibility criteria until the principal foreign national has been authorized to enter Canada and work under section R186.\n\n#### Principal foreign national is work-permit exempt, TRV-exempt\n\nGiven that foreign nationals are not authorized to work under section R186 until after their entry to Canada, the principal foreign national must enter Canada before the family members. The family members can then provide proof that the principal foreign national is working under section R186 when they apply for an open work permit before entry.\n\n### Family group at the port of entry\n\nIf the family members present themselves as a group at the port of entry, they must **all** meet the requirements under [subsection R198(1)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-198.html).\n\nThe principal foreign national’s application is assessed **first**, before the rest of the family.\n\nThe principal family members application in the group may be considered as documentary evidence of the authority to work in Canada, the occupational level and the 6 month duration.\n\nIf the family members are TRV-exempt, and the principal foreign national has preceded them to Canada and was allowed entry with an assessment that they met the requirements of section R186 [other than paragraphs R186(f, v or w)], the family members may apply at the port of entry.\n\n### Family groups in Canada\n\nPrincipal foreign nationals and family members may apply as a family group in Canada if they meet the requirements of section R199.\n\nOfficers should assess the principal foreign national’s application first. After the decision is finalized on the principal foreign national, the processing officer should assess the rest of the family group.\n\nFor example, family members can submit their application for an open work permit even if the principal foreign national is working without a work permit under the authority of paragraph R186(w). However, at the time of decision on that application, all eligibility requirements must be met.\n\n#### Family members of post-graduation work permit (PGWP) applicants\n\nFamily members of **post-graduation work permit PGWP applicants** cannot be issued an open work permit if the PGWP applicant is working without work permit under paragraph R186(w). The PGWP applicant continues working under paragraph R186(w) until the actual work permit is issued.\n\nAt the time of the PGWP application submission, the study permit holder and the family member(s) can submit their different work permit applications as a family group.\n\nAs with the family group outside Canada, the principal foreign national’s PGWP application would be assessed first, and then the family member’s open work permit application would be finalized.\n\nIf the family member applies for an open work permit after the principal foreign national submits their application for a PGWP, the principal foreign national must have been issued their work permit prior to the time of decision on the family member’s application.\n\nFor example, if the spouse applies separately, and the spouse’s application comes up for decision before the principal applicant’s application, and the officer did not have proof that the principal foreign national’s PGWP application has been approved, the principal applicant has not yet received approval on their PGWP application or has not been issued a PGWP and they are still working under paragraph R186(w). The spouse in this case is not eligible and the spousal open work permit application would be refused.\n\nApplication assessment\n----------------------\n\nOfficers must be satisfied that all eligibility requirements are **met at the time of decision** on the family member work permit application.\n\n**Mandatory association to the principal foreign national:** The family member must be associated with the principal foreign national in GCMS. Association should be completed on the “Client” screen and not just within the application.\n\nThis is required to ensure the ability to revoke a family member work permit under [public policy considerations](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/revocation-work-permit-public-policy-considerations.html).\n\nIf officers have any concerns as to the genuineness of the proof of employment or other documents provided, they may wish to undertake an assessment to ensure this material information is genuine and does not reflect a direct misrepresentation of facts in order to appear eligible for the permit.\n\n**Note:** The principal foreign national may be employed part-time for the dependent family member to qualify for this LMIA exemption. Although there is no standard minimum of hours required, officers have to be satisfied the **principal** foreign national’s wages or available funds will be sufficient to financially support themselves and their family members while they are in Canada.\n\nPrincipal foreign national\n--------------------------\n\nThe principal foreign national is the **first** foreign national in the couple who has applied for and obtained a work permit or was deemed authorized to work under the provisions of section R186.\n\nIn assessing eligibility for a family member open work permit, the principal foreign national continues to remain the principal in the couple and cannot obtain a spousal open work permit under subparagraph R205(c)(ii) off of the spousal open work permit of their spouse.\n\nFor example, if the principal foreign national is the holder of a work permit issued based on an LMIA and the dependent spouse obtains an open work permit under LMIA exemption code C47 as the spouse of a low-skilled worker, the principal foreign national cannot quit their job under the LMIA-based work permit and obtain a work permit in the high-skilled spousal category (code C41) on the basis of their spouse’s C47 open work permit and employment in a TEER category 0, 1, 2 or 3 occupation.\n\n**Important:** Dependent children cannot be the principal foreign national as per the definition in [subsection R1(3)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-1.html).\n\nGenuine relationship\n--------------------\n\nAs per [section R4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-4.html), a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse or a common-law partner of a person if the marriage or common-law partnership either\n\n* was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), or\n* is not genuine\n\nIf officers have concerns as to the genuineness of the relationship, they may request further documentation or information to confirm that the relationship between the dependent spouse or common-law partner and the principal foreign national is genuine and is not a relationship of convenience.\n\n### Dependent children and working age\n\nThere is no set minimum age to be eligible for a work permit. The submission of work permit applications on behalf of minor children is at the discretion of their parent(s) or authorized guardian(s).\n\nThe “working age” varies across provincial and territorial jurisdictions and there is no minimum age for work permit issuance specified in the IRPA or its regulations.\n\nAs such, unless there are reasonable grounds for an officer to be satisfied that a dependent child is unable to perform the work sought or any other reasons for refusal, minors may be issued a work permit.\n\nIRCC and CBSA officers **are not required** to assess the minimum age requirements in the province of destination for dependent children. Therefore, the onus is on the Canadian employers to meet the requirements of the labour laws of the province of destination.\n\nPlease refer to the instructions on [who qualifies as a dependent child](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/non-economic-classes/dependent-children.html#assessing_dependent_children) to confirm if an applicant meets the definition of a dependent child in relation to the principal applicant.\n\nThe child must meet the definition of dependent child when we receive the work permit application **and** at time of decision.\n\n### Final decision\n\n#### Approval\n\nThe work permit will be issued under the authority of subparagraph R205(c)(ii),\n\nIn the GCMS on the Application screen, officers should enter the information below in the specified fields:\n\n| Field | Selection or input |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case type | 20 |\n| Province of destination | Unknown **Important:** For applications for family members of a provincial nominee or CSQ holder who have not submitted an application for permanent residence, the province of nomination or selection **should match the principal foreign national’s**. |\n| Exemption code | C47 - Spouse of low-skilled worker C48 - Child of a low-skilled worker |\n| Employer | Open |\n| Intended occupation | Open |\n| NOC | 99999 |\n| Duration | The open work permit may be issued for a period that ends no later than the period of authorized stay of the principal foreign national or the date the applicant’s passport expires, whichever comes first. If the principal foreign national is authorized to work without a permit under [paragraph R186(u)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) at the time the family member’s work permit application is submitted, the application should be placed on hold until the principal foreign national’s work permit application is assessed. |\n| Conditions | * Officers should ensure that the instructions provided in [Medical conditions to be imposed for occupation-restricted work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html#conditions-restricted) and [Work permit issuance in GCMS: Occupation or location restricted](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html#issuance-restricted) are followed. |\n| **User remarks** **Mandatory** | The following remark must be added to all open work permits: **Authorized to work as per applicable labour laws.** |\n| Fees | $155 work permit processing fee $100 open work permit holder fee |\n| Biometrics | Work permit applicants are required to provide biometric information and pay the biometric fee – $85 The regular biometric exemptions apply (for example, under 14 or 1 in 10 rule). |\n\n#### Refusals\n\nWhen officers are not satisfied that the specific eligibility factors for this administrative code are met, they need to clearly document their reasons in the refusal note.\n\nWhen officers are not satisfied that the specific eligibility factors for this administrative code are met, they need to clearly document their reasons in the refusal note.\n\nThe officer needs to engage with the documentary evidence that was provided by the applicant. Simply stating, “I have reviewed the submissions, and I am not satisfied that section R205 is met”, is not sufficient for another reasonable person to understand the logic of the decision without reviewing all of the evidence again.\n\nIf an officer has determined that the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements, the work permit application should be refused. Officers should follow the steps in [Decision-making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html) when finalizing their refusal notes.\n\nThe grounds in the refusal letter should reflect what the officer has stated in their notes.\n\nWork permits shall be issued if all of the requirements stated in [section R200](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html) are met. Therefore, refusal grounds should be linked to one of those requirements. Below is an example of the requirements:\n\n* **R200(1)(c)(ii) –** The applicant has not met the eligibility requirements of the International Mobility Program work permit category. Officers need to explain clearly what eligibility requirements were not met.\n* **For example:** The principal applicant holds a work permit that is valid for a period of less than 6 months **after** the receipt date of the family member’s open work permit application. The work permit application should be refused under subparagraph R200(1)(c)(ii), since their work is not described in section R205. The applicant has not provided proof showing the principal applicant is authorized (that the work permit issued) or is provisionally approved (that the letter of introduction was issued) to work in Canada for a period of at least 6 months or longer **after** the receipt date of the family member’s open work permit application. They do not meet the eligibility requirements that would make their work described in section R205.\n\nPrevious updates\n----------------\n\n[March 28, 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/updates/2024-open-work-permit-family.html)\n\n[July 13, 2023](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/updates/2023-public-policy-competitiveness-economy-imp.html)\n\n[January 30, 2023](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/updates/2023-policy-competitiveness-economy-imp.html)\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2025-02-03",
