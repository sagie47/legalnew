It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\n**Note:** Some [Entry/Exit information](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/entry-exit.html) can be accessed in GCMS by conducting a query through the application screen. Since February 26, 2019, all land entry and exit records (on all travellers, including Canadian and US citizens) and all air entry records are available. The Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) started to onboard air carriers between June 2020 and June 2021 to obtain air exit information. As of June 2021, all air exit information is available through a query in GCMS. Entry/exit information can be used to assess residence and to check for overstays. Data is collected point forward and not available for records that predate February 26, 2019.\n\nIn these instructions, “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency.\n\nOn June 12, 2017, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), in coordination with Employment and Social Development Canada, launched the Global Skills Strategy and introduced new work permit exemptions for certain high-skilled work of a short duration.\n\nThe minister of IRCC has established a [public policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/short-term-work.html) under [section A25.2](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-25.2.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that justifies the granting of a work permit exemption to certain highly skilled foreign nationals coming to Canada for 15 or 30 days to perform work in an occupation that meets the eligibility requirements.\n\nOn this page\n------------\n\n* [Eligibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/short-term-exemption.html#conditions)\n* [Documentary evidence](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/short-term-exemption.html#evidence)\n* [Assessment](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/short-term-exemption.html#s1)\n * [Departure and re-entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/short-term-exemption.html#s2)\n * [Multiple employers](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/short-term-exemption.html#s3)\n * [Subsequent exemptions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/short-term-exemption.html#s4)\n\n* [Document issuance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/short-term-exemption.html#s5)\n * [Port of entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/short-term-exemption.html#s7)\n * [Visitor record coding](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/short-term-exemption.html#s8)\n\nEligibility\n-----------\n\nBased on public policy considerations, delegated officers may grant foreign nationals seeking to enter Canada a work permit exemption from the requirement in [paragraph R183(1)(b)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-183.html)and[section R196](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-196.html)of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) if the foreign national is intending to perform work\n\n* in a TEER category 0 or 1 occupation in the [National Occupational Classification](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/)\n* for one of the following periods up to\n * **15 consecutive days** where the foreign national has not been granted an exemption under this public policy in the last **6 months**\n * **30 consecutive days** where the foreign national has not been granted an exemption under this public in the last **12 months**\n\nPersons eligible may also need a [temporary resident visa (TRV) or an electronic travel authorization (eTA)](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/visas.asp) to come to Canada.\n\nUpon receipt of an application for this exemption at the port of entry, officers should verify in the system whether the foreign national has previously used this exemption. For more information, see [departure and re-entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/short-term-exemption.html#s2).\n\nApplicants already in Canada are not eligible to make an initial application within Canada for this exemption.\n\nDocumentary evidence\n--------------------\n\nForeign nationals must provide evidence to satisfy an officer that they are eligible for this exemption.\n\nEvidence may include documents such as a job offer or contract from the employer with\n\n* details of the work\n* the NOC code and job title of the intended occupation\n* the period of employment (start date and end date)\n\nAssessment\n----------\n\nWhen the officer reviews the application for a short-term work permit exemption, additional factors that must be considered are as follows.\n\n### Departure and re-entry\n\nForeign nationals are allowed to exit and re-enter Canada within the prescribed time frame (15 or 30 consecutive days) of work under the exemption. However, the authorized work period begins on the date the exemption is granted and is counted consecutively, regardless of whether the person is actually working in Canada.\n\nAny travel outside Canada after the date the exemption was granted will not extend the length of the exemption period.\n\n[Entry/Exit information](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/entry-exit.html) is available in the GCMS by conducting a query through the application screen.\n\n**Example of travelling during the exemption period:** The foreign national was granted a 15-day exemption on August 1, 2017. If they travel outside Canada for two days within that 15-day period (August 6 to August 7, 2017), they may resume work activities on August 8 under this exemption until August 15, 2017, only.\n\nOfficers at the port of entry should be satisfied that the 15 or 30 consecutive days under the short-term work permit exemption have not elapsed and that the foreign national is admissible to Canada.\n\nApplicants already in Canada are not eligible to make an initial application within Canada for this exemption.\n\n**Example of how to count the 6-month waiting period:** If the foreign national was granted the exemption on January 1, 2017, the 15 consecutive days of work are from January 1, 2017, to January 15, 2017, and the 6-month period is from January 1 to July 1, 2017. The new period of eligibility starts on July 2, 2017.\n\n### Multiple employers\n\nThis work permit exemption applies to the foreign national and not to the employer. Each foreign national is authorized to work without a permit under the public policy for a 15-day period every 6 months or for a 30-day period every 12 months.\n\nIf the foreign national enters Canada under the 15-day or 30-day work permit exemption and intends to work for more than one employer during that period, the foreign national is required to demonstrate that the work they intend to perform during that period is in a TEER 0 or 1 occupation under the NOC.\n\nThey may demonstrate this with evidence such as a job offer and/or a letter from each employer attesting to the details of the work and outlining the period of employment (start date and end date). For more information, see [Documentary evidence](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/short-term-exemption.html#evidence).\n\n### Subsequent exemptions\n\nThe following cases provide guidance for when foreign nationals can benefit from short-term work permit exemptions if they have already used another short-term exemption.\n\nIf foreign nationals have benefitted from the 15-day exemption in the past, they may be granted the following:\n\n* a subsequent 15-day exemption if they have not been granted a short-term work permit exemption in the last 6 months\n* a 30-day or [120-day exemption](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/researcher-exemption.html) once 12 months have elapsed since the 15-day exemption was granted\n\nIf foreign nationals have benefitted from the 30-day exemption in the past, they may be granted the following:\n\n* a subsequent 30-day exemption if they have not been granted a short-term work permit exemption in the last 12 months\n* a 15-day exemption once 6 months have elapsed since the 30-day exemption was granted (they may be granted a 120-day exemption once 12 months have elapsed since the 30-day exemption was granted)\n\nDocument issuance\n-----------------\n\n### Port of entry\n\nWhere the border services officer has determined that the foreign national is work permit exempt, they are requested to document the foreign national’s entry by the issuance of a visitor record [IMM 1097].\n\nThe visitor record with a notation that the holder is authorized to work without a work permit helps Service Canada [issue a social insurance number](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/sin/required-documents.html#h2.03) (SIN).\n\nIn cases where the officer has not proactively issued a visitor record, it may be issued on request of the foreign national. The foreign national may require a visitor record with a condition authorizing work in order to apply for a SIN and be paid by their employer.\n\nWhere applicable, officers should document the work permit exemption in the case notes in the GCMS and check the system to determine whether the worker has been granted an exemption for a total of 30 days under the public policy in the last 12 months.\n\nIf the officer has concerns over the past use of this exemption, the onus will be on the foreign national to demonstrate they meet the requirements of this exemption.\n\n### Visitor record coding\n\nThe following conditions must be added in the **User Remarks** field in the GCMS so they are printed on the visitor record:\n\n“authorized to work in Canada as (insert position) for (insert duration, 15 or 30 days)”\n\nThese conditions are necessary for the client in their application for a SIN.\n\nRelated links\n-------------\n\n* [120-day work permit exemption for researchers](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/researcher-exemption.html)\n* [Authorized to work without a work permit under section R186 or exempt from the requirement to obtain a work permit pursuant to the Public Policy facilitating entry into Canada for short term work](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/authorization-work-without-work-permit-implied-status.html#_Authorized_to_work)\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2023-08-02",
