– Work permit exempt under paragraph R186(a)\n* [Investors – Administrative code

of application\n--------------------\n\nBusiness visitors are work permit exempt and therefore applications can be made at a port of entry, provided the applicant already has a valid temporary resident visa or electronic travel authorization to allow them to travel to Canada. Applicants must apply for and obtain the [temporary resident visa or electronic travel authorization](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/visas.asp) prior to travelling to Canada.\n\nOnly citizens of countries that are exempt from the requirement for a temporary resident visa may apply for a work permit at the port of entry. Citizens of [countries whose nationals require a visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html#visaRequired) are required to submit an application to an IRCC office abroad or from within Canada if they meet the conditions set out in [section 199](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-199.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.\n\nTo ensure a smooth entry to Canada, investors are required to submit their work permit application to an IRCC office prior to arrival in Canada.\n\nSpousal provisions – Administrative code T53\n--------------------------------------------\n\nDepending on the citizenship of the principal applicant, work authorization for accompanying spouses is also facilitated, with the exception of business visitors. For spouses, the length of stay, including extensions, should be the same as the principal applicant.\n\nSpecific details on spousal eligibility, including citizenship requirements, are in the[category pages](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific.html#categories).\n\nAn open work permit may be issued to the spouse of an investor, professional, technician or intra-corporate transferee from certain countries if the principal applicant is one of the following:\n\n* a citizen of Australia, Japan or Mexico\n* a permanent resident of Australia\n* a citizen of Malaysia for intra-corporate transferee (executives and managers only)\n\nFor citizens of Brunei an open work permit may be issued to the spouse of an intra-corporate transferee or professional only.\n\nExtending work permits issued under the CPTPP\n---------------------------------------------\n\nThe CPTPP allows for the extension of work permits originally issued in accordance with the CPTPP. Work permits may be extended at the discretion of the officer assessing the application, provided that the necessary documentary evidence has been submitted by the applicant to support the request.\n\nTo extend a CPTPP work permit, the employer must submit a new offer of employment and the applicant must comply with regular work permit extension requirements.\n\nWhen reviewing the duration requested by the employer, officers should examine the application and the offer of employment to ensure that the requirements and purpose of entry under the CPTPP are still being met. Extension applications under [section R201](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-201.html) should be made online. Applications submitted at a port of entry or at an IRCC office outside of Canada are considered to be new work permit applications under [section R200](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html).\n\nExamples of acceptable documentation to support an extension include the following:\n\n* a service contract extension justification from the offering enterprise\n* updated business plans\n* an offer for a new contract\n* feasibility studies and marketing plans\n\nDetermining eligibility\n-----------------------\n\nTo determine eligibility, officers should consider the following factors:\n\n* the **intentions** of the applicant \n * What is the applicant doing in Canada?\n * How long has the applicant been here?\n * How long is the request for?\n\n* the **reason given** by the applicant for applying for the extension \n * Are the plans well thought out or merely frivolous?\n * Has the applicant previously received an extension?\n\n* the applicant’s **situation in their home country**\n * What family, employment or other responsibilities and obligations has the person left behind?\n * How have these responsibilities been discharged?\n * Is a prolonged stay in Canada reasonable and feasible?\n\n* the **initial intent** of the application \n * What was the original purpose of the business visit to Canada?\n * Has the original purpose of the business visit been fulfilled?\n * If the original purpose of the business visit has not been fulfilled, was sufficient time originally granted to fulfill the purpose?\n\n* the **necessary licence or documentation** to practise the applicant’s occupation in Canada in instances where an occupation is regulated at a provincial or territorial level \n * For example, in most provinces and territories, electrician and plumber are regulated occupations and require documentation to be practised.\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2023-06-22",
