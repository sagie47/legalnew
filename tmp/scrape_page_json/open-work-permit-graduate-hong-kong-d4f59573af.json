It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nThe [Hong Kong open work permit public policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/hong-kong-residents-open-work-permit-2023.html) allows foreign nationals who hold either an HKSAR or BNO passport, to apply for an open work permit which may be issued for up to 3 years. This public policy expires on February 7, 2025.\n\nThis public policy exempts these applications from the requirements of [paragraph R200(1)(c)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations. Applicants can be residing in Canada or overseas at the time of application.\n\nApplications made under this public policy cannot be made on entry; therefore, these instructions **do not** apply to officers employed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). Work permit applications must be submitted online.\n\nThe instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with the following:\n\n* [Open work permit– General processing and issuance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html)\n*

this open work permit public policy, the following exemptions also apply for Hong Kong residents:\n\n* [Paragraphs R199(a) to (I)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-199.html) are waived – Hong Kong residents in Canada as visitors are eligible to apply inland for an open work permit under the public policy.\n* [Paragraph R200(3)(e)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-200.html) is waived – Hong Kong residents are not prohibited from being issued a work permit if the prohibition is only under paragraph R200(3)(e), that is, if they have engaged in unauthorized work or study in Canada or have failed to comply with the conditions of a previous permit or authorization, unless they engaged in unauthorized work for an employer described in [section R196.1.](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-196.1.html)\n\nOn this

these facilitative measures, the following clients may be eligible as a principal applicant or an accompanying dependant:\n\n* [residents of Hong Kong](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/hong-kong.html#s1-1), as defined in the Immigration and

[R303.2(1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-303.2.html). All other applicable fees must be paid.\n\n**Important:** If this fee is paid in error, it must be refunded as per the processing office’s normal refund procedures.\n\n#### Mandatory tracking of fee waivers\n\nFor all applications received after November 12, 2020, the cost recovery fee exemption code 999, as well as a reference to “**Hong Kong Special Measures**” (in the notes section), must be used to identify all waived fees. This will indicate that no revenue is expected by the department.\n\nHolders of HKSAR passports are visa-exempt and may apply for an electronic travel authorization (eTA) to come to Canada. The Hong Kong Document of Identity cannot be used in place of an HKSAR passport and, therefore, cannot be used to apply for an eTA or for any other application.\n\nRequired supporting documents\n-----------------------------\n\nApplicants applying for an open work permit under the public policy must select in the online application tool that they are “Applying for a work permit under an active public policy or special measure announced by IRCC” for them to trigger the open work permit results.\n\nHowever, officers should note that the document checklist includes more documents than are required for this program.

The prerequisite post-secondary degree or diploma must have been obtained in the 5 years immediately preceding the **start of the post-graduate program**. For example, if the applicant started their post-graduate studies in the fall of 2021, then their post-secondary degree or diploma must have been obtained between the fall of 2016 and the summer of 2021.\n\n### Mandatory documents\n\n* Copy of educational credential, transcripts, or proof of enrolment at a post-secondary educational institution\n* Copy of HKSAR or BNO passport\n* Family Information form [IMM 5707]\n* CV or resume\n* Digital photo\n* Payment receipt in the Proof of Fee Exemption slot\n\n#### “Not applicable” documents\n\n* Employment reference letter\n* Letter from current employer\n* Employment records\n* Employment contract\n\n### Police certificates\n\nAs with any case, the officer reviewing the file **may request a police certificate** in order to be fully satisfied that the applicant is not criminally inadmissible.\n\nWork permit extension or change of conditions\n---------------------------------------------\n\nHKSAR and BNO passport holders already in Canada are eligible to either extend their stay or apply for their initial open work permit from within Canada under the public policy. They **cannot apply at a port of entry**. Applicants are also eligible to extend their initial open work permit issued under the Hong Kong open work permit public policy for another 3 years.\n\nFor in-Canada work permit extension applications, a copy of the CV or resume is not required.\n\n### Work permit issuance in GCMS\n\nThe work permit will be issued under the authority of paragraph R200(1)(c) and will be coded as shown below.\n\n| Field | Selection or input |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case type | 20 |\n| Province of destination | Leave blank |\n| City of destination | Leave blank or unknown |\n| NOC | 99999 (generic code) |\n| Intended occupation | Open |\n| Employer | Open |\n| Duration | Up to 3 years |\n| Fee exemption codes | * In-Canada applicants: Work permit extension fee waiver: 999 * All applicants: Open work permit holder fee: P03 |\n\nSpouses or common-law partners and dependent children\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nAn open work permit may be issued, under LMIA exemption code R01, for overseas applications, and R02 for applications submitted from within Canada, to the spouse, common-law partner, or dependent children if the principal applicant is approved for a work permit under the public policy. Dependent children who have reached the age of majority (that is, 18 years of age and older) are also eligible to apply for an open work permit.\n\nFamily members applying for an open work permit under the Hong Kong open work permit public policy are also exempt from paying the open work permit holder fee ($100).\n\n### Study permit\n\nMinor children can apply for a study permit under existing study permit streams or may study without one at the K –12 level if they are already in Canada and at least one parent is a work or study permit holder.
