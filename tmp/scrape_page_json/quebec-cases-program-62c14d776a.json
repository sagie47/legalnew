For example, the work permit of family members of the principal applicant must be restricted by the province (**not by the city**). This condition should be added: **Not authorized to work at any other location.** |\n| **User remarks (Mandatory)** | The following remark must be added to all open work permits: **Authorized to work anywhere in the province of Quebec as per applicable labour laws.** |\n| Fees | $155 work permit processing fee $100 open work permit holder fee |\n| Biometrics | Work permit applicants are required to provide biometric information and pay the biometric fee ($85). The regular biometric exemptions apply (for example, age or 1 in 10). |\n\n### Refusals\n\nIf an officer has determined that the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements, the work permit application should be refused. They should record their reasons for decision as per the instructions in: [Decision-making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html).\n\n**Example:**\n\n“Under subparagraph 204(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, a labour market impact assessment-exempt open work permit may be issued under administrative code T10 – Quebec Investors Program if the applicant received a valid Quebec notice of intent to select.\n\nBased on the information you have submitted, you have not demonstrated that you meet the eligibility criteria for this type of work permit.

Family members are not required to provide proof that the principal applicant is employed **at the time of decision** on the family member application.\n\n**The family member’s work permit must always be restricted to the province of Quebec.**\n\nThe open work permit for the family member should have a validity that matches the principal applicant’s or that of the passport or travel document of the family member, whichever is earlier.\n\n### Study permits\n\nThe instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with [Temporary residents: Students](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits.html).\n\n### Temporary resident visa (TRV) or electronic travel authorization (eTA)\n\n* Preschool-age dependants need to apply for either a temporary resident visa (TRV) or an electronic travel authorization (eTA).
