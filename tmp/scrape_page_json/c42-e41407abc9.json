It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nEffective immediately, most foreign nationals in Canada are no longer eligible to apply for a work permit at a port of entry.\n\nThe following work permit applications are exempt from the above restrictions and may still be accepted for processing at a port of entry:\n\n* **applicants who are citizens or permanent residents of the United States of America (USA)**\n* **professionals and technicians under free trade agreements (FTAs)**\n * professionals under the FTA with the USA and Mexico (T36)\n * professionals under the FTA with Chile (F22)\n * contractual service suppliers or independent professionals under the FTA with South Korea (F32)\n * professionals under the FTA with Panama (F42)\n * professionals or technicians under the FTA with Colombia (F12)\n * professionals or technicians under the FTA with Peru (F52)\n\n* **spouses or common-law partners**of applicants under the FTAs with South Korea (F32), Panama (F42) and Colombia (F12)\n* **truck drivers** who are required to depart Canada for the purpose of their employment and, prior to their departure from Canada, held a work permit or maintained status as a result of a pending application for work permit renewal (this does not include truck drivers operating solely within Canada)\n* **applicants with pre-scheduled Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) appointments**\n\n**Important:** Only spouses or common-law partners of study permit holders are eligible for an open work permit. Their dependent children are **not** eligible to apply for an open work permit under this category (C42).\n\n**Note:** As of January 21, 2025, only spouses of principal foreign nationals in doctorate programs, certain eligible programs or professional programs, and master’s programs of 16 months or longer are eligible for an open work permit. In-Canada spouses of students may seek open work permit renewals, under the criteria that existed when their current work permit was processed, only if they are requesting a permit duration that aligns with the study authorization that the principal foreign national received to complete their current program.\n\nIn these instructions, “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).\n\nThe instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with the following:\n\n* [Open work permit – General processing and issuance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html)\n* [Conditions and validity period on work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html)\n\nThis International Mobility Program work permit category is intended for spouses and common-law partners who are not, themselves, already study permit holders actively engaged in full-time studies. The reason for allowing spouses to enter Canada and work is to increase the competitiveness of Canada’s academic institutions or economy.\n\nThe spouse must have sufficient funds to support themselves and any accompanying dependants separate from the funds used to support the principal foreign national’s study permit application.\n\n**In these instructions, the term “spouse” refers to either a common-law partner or a married spouse.**\n\nOn this page\n------------\n\n*

Should officers have any concerns, they may wish to request additional information from the applicant to ensure that the eligibility requirements of the work permit category (administrative code C42) are met, or they may undertake an assessment to ensure the material documents provided in the spousal open work permit application are bona fide.\n\nForeign nationals who are eligible for processing under administrative code C42 are subject to all other eligibility and admissibility requirements (including section[A39](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-2.5/section-39.html)) under the IRPA and the IRPR.\n\nOfficers must be satisfied that all eligibility requirements **are met at the time of the decision** on the spousal work permit application.\n\nIf officers have any concerns as to the genuineness of the documents provided, they may wish to undertake an assessment to ensure this material information is genuine and does not reflect a misrepresentation of facts to appear eligible for the permit.\n\n### Principal foreign nationals\n\nThe principal foreign national is the first foreign national of the couple who obtained a study or work permit or was deemed authorized to work under the provisions of section R186, other than under paragraphs R186(v) or (w).\n\nIn assessing eligibility for a spousal open work permit, the principal foreign national continues to remain the principal in the couple.\n\nThe principal foreign national cannot obtain a spousal open work permit under the work permit categories provided under the administrative codes C41, C42, C47 or C49 based on the dependent spouse’s spousal open work permit and Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER) category.\n\nFor example, if the principal foreign national is a study permit holder and the dependent spouse obtains an open work permit under administrative code C42 for spouses of study permit holders, the study permit holder cannot quit their studies and obtain a work permit in the C41 spousal category on the basis of their spouse’s C42 open work permit and employment.\n\n### Genuine relationship\n\nIn accordance with [section R4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-4.html), a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse or a common-law partner of a person if the marriage or common-law partnership either\n\n* was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the IRPA, or\n* is not genuine.\n\nIf officers have concerns as to the genuineness of the relationship, to be procedurally fair, they should request further documentation or information to confirm that the relationship between the dependent spouse and the principal foreign national is genuine and is not a relationship of convenience. Procedural fairness means giving the applicant the opportunity to respond to the concerns of the officer prior to any decision.\n\nIf the officer believes that the applicant has misrepresented themselves, the officer should follow the instructions for proceeding with a determination.\n\n### Final decision\n\n#### Approval\n\nThe work permit will be issued under the authority of subparagraph R205(c)(ii).\n\nIn GCMS, under the “Application” screen, officers should enter the information below in the specified fields.\n\n| Field | Selection or input |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case type | 20 |\n| Province of destination | Unknown |\n| Exemption code | C42: Spouse or common-law partner of a full-time student |\n| Employer | Open |\n| Intended occupation | Open |\n| Special program codes | **SPGradC42** Description: Spouse or common-law partner of a student in a master’s program of longer than 16 months or a doctorate program **SPPilC42** Description: Spouse or common-law partner of an international student who holds a valid study permit and is participating in one of the eligible programs administered by a province or territory **SPProC42** Description: Spouses or common-law partners of students in professional programs **Note:** Officers will need to manually enter the applicable code for applications submitted by representatives, as this is not triggered in the Authorized Paid Representative Portal. |\n| National Occupational Classification (NOC) | 99999 Do not use other synthetic NOC codes. |\n| Duration | Initial applications The open work permit may be issued for a period that ends no later than the validity of the principal foreign national’s study permit or the expiry of the applicant’s passport or biometrics, whichever comes first. Extension applications The spouse of a principal foreign national may receive an extension on a current study authorization or a new study permit application if the principal foreign national is enrolled in * a master’s program of 16 months or longer, or * a doctorate program, or * a professional program or * participating in one of the [eligible programs](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/help-your-spouse-common-law-partner-work-canada.html) All other college or undergraduate studies are permitted only administrative extensions to the principal foreign national’s existing study authorization or the applicant’s passport or biometric expiry, whichever comes first. If the principal foreign national is authorized to study without a permit under [section R189](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-189.html) at the time the spouse’s work permit application is submitted, the spousal application should be placed on hold until the principal foreign national’s study permit extension application is finalized. |\n| Conditions | Officers should ensure that instructions provided in [Medical conditions to be imposed for open employers but occupation-restricted work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html) are followed. |\n| Fees | Work permit processing fee: $155 Open work permit holder fee: $100 Biometric fee (if applicable): $85 |\n| Biometrics | Work permit applicants are required to provide their biometrics. The regular biometric exemptions apply (for example, under 14 years or 1 in 10 rule). |\n\n#### Refusals\n\nIf an officer is not satisfied that all the requirements of section R200, including the assessment under subparagraph R205(c)(ii), are met, they must record their reasons and outline the rationale underlying the decision as well as the facts and elements considered in a case note.\n\nRefusal reasons should clearly indicate which criteria or what requirements of section R200 were not met and explain how the conclusion was reached. For assistance, officers can follow the steps in [Decision-making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html).\n\nFor example, if the applicant does not have sufficient funds to support themselves, the officer can indicate that paragraph R200(1)(b) is not met, as they are not satisfied that the applicant would be able to support themselves during their stay and pay for their departure from Canada given that an open work permit does not guarantee employment in Canada during the period of authorized stay. Therefore, they are not satisfied that the applicant will leave Canada at the end of their authorized stay.\n\nPrevious updates\n----------------\n\n* [July 13, 2023](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/updates/2023-public-policy-competitiveness-economy-imp.html)\n* [January 30, 2023](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/updates/2023-policy-competitiveness-economy-imp.html)\n* [March 19, 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/updates/2024-spouses-common-law-study.html)\n* [May 22, 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/updates/2024-spouses-common-law-study-c42.html)\n* [November 8, 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html)\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2025-01-23",

It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nEffective immediately, most foreign nationals in Canada are no longer eligible to apply for a work permit at a port of entry.\n\nThe following work permit applications are exempt from the above restrictions and may still be accepted for processing at a port of entry:\n\n* **applicants who are citizens or permanent residents of the United States of America (USA)**\n* **professionals and technicians under free trade agreements (FTAs)**\n * professionals under the FTA with the USA and Mexico (T36)\n * professionals under the FTA with Chile (F22)\n * contractual service suppliers or independent professionals under the FTA with South Korea (F32)\n * professionals under the FTA with Panama (F42)\n * professionals or technicians under the FTA with Colombia (F12)\n * professionals or technicians under the FTA with Peru (F52)\n\n* **spouses or common-law partners**of applicants under the FTAs with South Korea (F32), Panama (F42) and Colombia (F12)\n* **truck drivers** who are required to depart Canada for the purpose of their employment and, prior to their departure from Canada, held a work permit or maintained status as a result of a pending application for work permit renewal (this does not include truck drivers operating solely within Canada)\n* **applicants with pre-scheduled Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) appointments**\n\n**Important:** Only spouses or common-law partners of study permit holders are eligible for an open work permit. Their dependent children are **not** eligible to apply for an open work permit under this category (C42).\n\n**Note:** As of January 21, 2025, only spouses of principal foreign nationals in doctorate programs, certain eligible programs or professional programs, and master’s programs of 16 months or longer are eligible for an open work permit. In-Canada spouses of students may seek open work permit renewals, under the criteria that existed when their current work permit was processed, only if they are requesting a permit duration that aligns with the study authorization that the principal foreign national received to complete their current program.\n\nIn these instructions, “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).\n\nThe instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with the following:\n\n* [Open work permit – General processing and issuance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html)\n* [Conditions and validity period on work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html)\n\nThis International Mobility Program work permit category is intended for spouses and common-law partners who are not, themselves, already study permit holders actively engaged in full-time studies. The reason for allowing spouses to enter Canada and work is to increase the competitiveness of Canada’s academic institutions or economy.\n\nThe spouse must have sufficient funds to support themselves and any accompanying dependants separate from the funds used to support the principal foreign national’s study permit application.\n\n**In these instructions, the term “spouse” refers to either a common-law partner or a married spouse.**\n\nOn this page\n------------\n\n* [Eligibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#eligibility)\n * [Initial applications](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#initial-applications)\n * [Extension applications](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#extension-applications)\n\n* [Documentary evidence](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#documentary-evidence)\n * [Applications received before March 19, 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#application-before)\n * [Applications received between March 19, 2024, and April 29, 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#application-after)\n * [Applications received between April 30, 2024, and January 20, 2025](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#application-after-april)\n * [Applications received on or after January 21, 2025](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#application-after-january)\n * [Extensions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#extensions)\n\n* [Application assessment](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#assessment)\n * [Principal foreign nationals](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#principal-foreign-national)\n * [Genuine relationship](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#genuine-relationship)\n * [Final decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#decision)\n\n* [Previous updates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#updates)\n\nEligibility\n-----------\n\nTo be considered a dependent spouse, the applicant for an open work permit must be in a[genuine relationship](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#genuine-relationship)with a[principal foreign national in one of the situations listed below](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#principal-foreign-national)."
