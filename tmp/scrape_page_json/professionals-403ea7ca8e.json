If it is not available, consult the national wage.\n\n * or\n * the wage that is within the wage range that the employer is paying their current employees hired for the same job and work location, and with the same skills and years of experience\n\nDocumentary evidence\n--------------------\n\nA foreign national must provide sufficient documentary evidence to satisfy an officer that they are eligible for entry.\n\nThe following documents are required:\n\n* proof of citizenship or permanent residence in an eligible CPTPP country\n* an offer of employment submitted through the Employer Portal or through [alternate means](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/place-application-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-study-permit-work-permit/exempt-electronic-applications.html#exceptions) if authorized \n * The offer of employment provides confirmation of the pre-arranged employment \n * the proposed employer in Canada;\n * the profession for which entry is sought;\n * details of the position (title, duties, duration of employment, arrangements as to payment; and\n * the educational qualifications or alternative credentials required for the position.\n\n* proof of educational qualifications and any additional credentials required to discharge job duties in Canada (such as licensing or certification)\n* if the occupation is regulated by the province or territory, evidence of licensing or certification in their occupation from the applicable Canadian or foreign regulatory body (see[Regulated or certified occupations – Processing of work permit applications](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/regulated-certified-occupations.html) )\n* proof of work experience\n* The onus is on the foreign national to provide evidence that they meet the eligibility criteria. Evidence may include, but is not limited to, the following: \n * reference letters\n * letter of support from the company\n * job descriptions that outlines the level of training acquired\n * years of experience in the field\n * degrees or certifications obtained in the field\n * list of publications and awards (where applicable)\n * a detailed description of the work to be performed in Canada\n\n**Important:**The Canadian company must submit an offer of employment and pay the employer compliance fee through the IRCC[Employer Portal](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/partners-service-providers/employer-portal.html), as it is the Canadian company that is creating the need for the temporary worker to enter Canada. The offer of employment does not establish the standard employee-employer relationship as normally understood in the labour force; however, the company submitting the offer of employment is responsible for the conditions outlined in the regulations for the International Mobility Program, and may be subject to the[employer compliance regime](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/hire-temporary-foreign/international-mobility-program/inspections.html).\n\nApplication assessment\n----------------------\n\n### Language requirement\n\nIf an officer has concerns about the applicant’s ability to communicate in 1 of the 2 official languages, the officer may ask the applicant to provide evidence to satisfy the officer that the applicant’s language abilities will permit them to perform the specific job for which they were hired and that they understand the health and safety requirements of their workplace.\n\nOfficers may request documentary evidence, such as the level of English- or French-language education obtained, correspondence with the intended employer and examples of previous work undertaken in countries where English or French is an official language, to aid them in assessing language ability.\n\nSee[Assessing language requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/assessing-language-requirements.html)for instructions on how officers can assess language ability.\n\n**Note:**An applicant whose letter of offer outlines specific official language requirements**must**satisfy the officer that they meet those requirements.\n\n### Length of stay\n\nThe initial length of stay is 1 year.\n\nExtensions are allowed if the applicant is able to provide documentation that satisfies the processing officer of their need to have their stay extended.\n\nSee[Extending work permits under the CPTPP](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific.html#extending)for details on when an application can be extended.\n\n### Review of the offer of employment\n\nWhen assessing if the work permit application meets the requirements for a CPTPP professional or technician, officers should review the offer of employment that appears under the Employment Details tab in the Global Case Management System (GCMS) for information provided by the employer or the matching fields on the IMM 5802 form (if the employer was authorized to use it).\n\n| Field | Considerations |\n| --- | --- |\n| **LMIA Exemption Code** | **T52** – CPTPP – R204(a) – Professionals and technicians |\n| **Requirements Exemptions Met** | Information in this field outlines how the job and the foreign national meet the regulatory and trade agreement requirements, including that the applicant * will work in a TEER 0, 1, 2 or 3 occupation (or [NOC 0, A or B occupation](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/)) if the application is received on or before November 15, 2022) listed in the[country-specific occupations](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific/professionals.html#a4) * has the minimum educational and work experience requirements of their TEER category and occupation * has the required licence or certification if their occupation is regulated in the province or territory of destination |\n| **NOC and Job Title** | Ensure that the occupational code and title are in the appropriate TEER for the occupation capacity. |\n| **Duration** | 1 year maximum duration for initial work permit |\n| **Employer** | Does the offer of employment provide confirmation of the pre-arranged employment? Is the proposed employer in Canada? Does the offer of employment give accurate details of the profession for which entry is sought: * title * duties * duration of employment * arrangements as to payment? |\n| **Duties and Job Requirements** | These are the activities that the foreign national will be performing. * Do they align with the occupation? * Are there specific requirements that align with the professional or technician category of the applicant? * Does the employer require more than the minimum amount of paid work experience? |\n| **Wages** | Is the remuneration similar to other similarly qualified professionals or technicians in the industry in the region where the work is performed? Officers should confirm that the wages are reasonable for the occupation. To prevent wage suppression, wages should not be lower than the prevailing wage for the occupation in the location of work. Additional allowances provided outside of wages are not to be included when assessing if wages meet the prevailing wage. For example, housing or travel allowances. There is no requirement that the foreign national be paid by the Canadian enterprise or in Canadian dollars. However, wages in the offer must be consistent with the Canadian prevailing wage, regardless of currency used. |\n| **Minimum Education Requirements** | Do the educational requirements outlined in the offer of employment align with the minimum education requirements of the professional or technician category? Are there additional or alternative requirements for this occupation defined in the NOC? |\n| **Other Training Required** | The employer may indicate specialty training as a requirement. |\n| **Provincial/Federal Certification, Licensing or Registration** | The employer should list any specific certification, licensing or registration required in Canada. Documented evidence should be provided with the application if the occupation is regulated by the province or territory; however, some occupations may require the foreign national to write an exam after they enter Canada, for example, for a licence from a regulated body or a first aid certificate. |\n\nRefer to[Employer-specific work permits – General processing – International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html)for further guidance\n\n### Pre-arranged employment\n\nIn this context, the Canadian employer may be an [enterprise](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#e1) or an individual. The following are some examples of pre-arranged employment:\n\n* an employee-employer relationship with a Canadian enterprise; or\n* a contract between the professional and a Canadian enterprise; or\n* a contract between the professional’s employer from an eligible CPTPP country and a Canadian enterprise.\n\n**Important:** The professionals and technicians category does not allow self-employment in Canada (i.e., soliciting business in the Canadian labour market). However, a citizen from a CPTPP country (or Australian permanent resident) who is self-employed outside Canada is not barred from the Professional and technicians category, provided the services to be rendered in Canada are pre-arranged with a Canadian employer.\n\n### Self-employment\n\nIf the Canadian enterprise is substantially controlled by the applicant, it is considered to be self-employment. For example, if the Canadian enterprise offering the employment is a sole proprietorship operated by the applicant, then entry cannot be granted under the Professionals and technicians category. Additionally, if the Canadian enterprise is legally distinct from the applicant, for example, a legal corporate entity but the entity is substantially controlled by the applicant, entry as a professional or technician must also be refused.\n\nIn order to determine if an enterprise is substantially controlled by the applicant, the following factors must be taken into account:\n\n* whether the applicant has established the business;\n* whether the applicant has primary, sole, or de facto control of the business;\n* whether the applicant is the primary, sole, or de facto owner of the business;\n* whether the applicant is the primary, sole, or de facto recipient of income of the business.\n\nWhen a professional or technician applies for a renewal of a work permit, the following activities may indicate that the applicant has been self-employed in Canada:\n\n* incorporation of a company in Canada expressly for the purpose of the business person being self-employed (incorporating does not automatically signify self-employment; the motives for incorporation need to be examined before making a determination);\n* initiation of communications (e.g., “job hunting” by direct mail or by advertising);\n* responding to advertisements for the purpose of obtaining employment or contracts; or\n* establishing an office which serves as a way to advertise (i.e., a “sign or a shingle” outside the door).\n\nThe following activities do not constitute self-employment:\n\n* responding to unsolicited inquiries about service which the professional or technician may be able to perform; or\n* establishing an office from which to deliver pre-arranged service to clients.\n\n### Occupational qualifications\n\nA professional or technician must be entering Canada to provide professional level services (TEER 0, 1, 2 or 3) in an eligible occupation for which they are qualified. In making this determination, both the qualification of the individual and the position in Canada must be considered.\n\nFor [regulated professions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/regulated-certified-occupations.html), the officer must be satisfied that the professional or technician has or can obtain the necessary licensing so that the applicant may [perform the work sought.](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/prohibitions.html#unable-perform)\n\nIn instances where a baccalaureate degree is required, the degree must be in the specific field or in a closely related field.\n\nIt is possible for a professional or technician to be working in Canada on more than one contract at a time. A work permit must be issued for each individual contract.\n\n### Training\n\nProfessionals or technicians with a valid work permit can provide training related to their profession, including conducting seminars.\n\nThe training session must be pre-arranged with a Canadian employer and the subject matter must be at the professional level. Entry does not allow seminar leaders to engage in training that is not pre-arranged with a Canadian employer.\n\nThe training must form part of the professional training or development of the participants and must be related to their job duties.\n\nCountry-specific occupations\n----------------------------\n\n* [### Australia](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific/professionals.html#details-panel1)\n* [### Brunei](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific/professionals.html#details-panel2)\n* [### Chile](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific/professionals.html#details-panel3)\n* [### Japan](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific/professionals.html#details-panel4)\n* [### Malaysia](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific/professionals.html#details-panel5)\n* [### Mexico](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific/professionals.html#details-panel6)\n* [### Peru](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/trans-pacific/professionals.html#details-panel7)\n\n### Australia\n\n#### Professionals\n\nCanadian educational requirements for Australian professionals should be deemed to be met whenever an Australian professional has met the Australian equivalent educational qualification.

“spousal” in this section refers to both married spouses and common-law partners.\n\nSpousal eligibility is based on the citizenship or permanent resident status of the principal applicant and their occupational level. The spouse or common-law partner does not have to be a citizen or national of 1 of the countries listed to apply.\n\n### Professionals\n\nAn open work permit may be issued to the spouse or common-law partner of a professional if the principal applicant is either of the following:\n\n* a citizen of Australia, Chile, Japan or Mexico\n* a permanent resident of Australia\n\n### Technicians\n\nAn open work permit may be issued to the spouse or common-law partner of a technician if the principal applicant is either of the following:\n\n* a citizen of Australia, Chile, Japan or Mexico\n* a permanent resident of Australia\n\n**Note:**The open work permit should have a validity that matches the principal applicant’s work permit. The spouse or common-law partner’s work permit may be issued at a port of entry (POE).\n\nFinal decision\n--------------\n\n### Approval\n\nThe work permit will be issued under the authority of paragraph [R204(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-204.html).\n\nIn GCMS, under the Application screen, officers should enter the information below in the specified fields.\n\n| Field | Selection or input |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Case type** | 52 |\n| **Province of destination** | The province of destination entered by the applicant should match the address of employment in the IMP offer of employment. This information is under the**Employment Details – LMIA-exempt**tab. If there is more than one location, officers should enter the primary location in the “Province of destination” field and the secondary location in the “User remarks” field. |\n| **City of destination** | The city of destination entered by the applicant should match the address of employment in the IMP offer of employment. This information is under the**Employment Details – LMIA-exempt**tab. If there is more than one location, officers should enter “Unknown” in the “City of destination” field and “As per the offer” in the “User remarks” field. |\n| **Exemption code** | **T52** – CPTPP – R204(a) – Professionals and technicians This code is auto-populated from the IMP offer of employment. |\n| **NOC** | The NOC code is auto-populated from the IMP offer of employment. |\n| **Intended occupation** | Job title This is auto-populated from the IMP offer of employment. |\n| **LMIA/LMIA-exempt #** | “A” number from the work permit application. This number is auto-populated from the work permit application, and it is what is used to “match” in the Portal. If the work permit application was submitted on paper, the officer must manually enter the number. |\n| **Employer** | Business operating name |\n| **Duration** | Officers may issue a work permit that is valid for the duration of the offer of employment (up to 1 year) or until the expiry of the travel document, whichever is earlier. Refer to[Validity period for work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html#validity) |\n\n**Note:**If the employer is authorized to use an IMM 5802 form instead of completing the offer of employment through the Employer Portal, please see[Employer-specific work permits – General processing – International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html) .\n\n### Refusal\n\nIf an officer is not satisfied that all the requirements of [R200](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html), including the assessment under [R204(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-204.html), are met, they must record their reasons and outline the rationale underlying the decision as well as the facts and elements considered. They must also provide an explanation for the decision in a case note.\n\nA decision is reasonable and therefore defendable when another person is able to trace the decision maker’s reasoning, without encountering fatal flaws in the overarching logic, and is satisfied that there is a line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the decision maker’s conclusion.\n\nThe officer needs to engage with the documentary evidence that was provided by the applicant. Simply stating ‘I have reviewed the submissions and I am not satisfied that R204 is met’ **is not sufficient** for another reasonable person to understand the logic of the decision without reviewing all of the evidence again.\n\nRefusal reasons should clearly indicate which criteria or what requirement of R200 was not met and explain how the conclusion was reached.\n\nFor assistance, officers can follow the steps in[Decision making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html).\n\n#### Refusal grounds in the GCMS\n\nThe GCMS has standard text for refusal grounds. Officers should ensure that the refusal grounds selected for the refusal letter match the reasons that they have stated in their case note.\n\nIf an officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant is not able to perform the work sought, they should select the paragraph “R200(3)(a)**You were not able to demonstrate that you will be able to adequately perform the work you seek**.” Officers should ensure that they clearly indicate in their refusal notes why they are not satisfied.\n\nGiven that there is no specific refusal ground for FTA categories in GCMS for when a officer is not satisfied that the criteria has been met, **they should select the refusal ground “Other” and add a short explanation in the Comments field that they are not satisfied that section R200 or paragraph R204(a) are met.**\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2024-10-03",

They must also provide an explanation for the decision in a case note.\n\nA decision is reasonable and therefore defendable when another person is able to trace the decision maker’s reasoning, without encountering fatal flaws in the overarching logic, and is satisfied that there is a line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the decision maker’s conclusion.\n\nThe officer needs to engage with the documentary evidence that was provided by the applicant. Simply stating ‘I have reviewed the submissions and I am not satisfied that R204 is met’ **is not sufficient** for another reasonable person to understand the logic of the decision without reviewing all of the evidence again.\n\nRefusal reasons should clearly indicate which criteria or what requirement of R200 was not met and explain how the conclusion was reached.\n\nFor assistance, officers can follow the steps in[Decision making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html)."
