It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nThis page contains operational guidance for officers who process foreign nationals destined to work in Quebec, through either of the following programs:\n\n* [Temporary Foreign Worker Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/quebec-cases.html#temporary-foreign-worker)\n* [International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/quebec-cases.html#international-mobility)\n\nOn this page\n------------\n\n* [Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/quebec-cases.html#temporary-foreign-worker)\n * [Canada–Quebec Accord](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/quebec-cases.html#canada-quebec-accord)\n * [Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) requirement](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/quebec-cases.html#quebec-acceptance)\n\n* [International Mobility Program (IMP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/quebec-cases.html#international-mobility)\n\nTemporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP)\n---------------------------------------\n\nCanada–Quebec Accord\n--------------------\n\nUnder the terms of article 22 of the [Canada–Quebec Accord](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/agreements/federal-provincial-territorial/quebec/canada-quebec-accord-relating-immigration-temporary-admission-aliens.html), Quebec’s consent is required to grant entry to temporary foreign workers who are subject to labour market impact assessment (LMIA) requirements.\n\nForeign workers whose destination is Quebec must obtain the consent from the ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’intégration (MIFI) to enter Quebec and take temporary employment. This consent is granted through the issuance of a Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ).\n\nAccording to the [Quebec Immigration Regulation](https://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/document/cr/I-0.2.1,%20r.%203), the Minister’s consent to enter Quebec, granted through the issuance of a CAQ, is not required if any of the following conditions apply:\n\n* The employment is continuous in duration for a maximum of 30 days.\n* The employment is **not** paid.\n* The foreign national’s employment does not require an assessment of the impact that the employment offer has on the Quebec labour market (term that designates an LMIA in the Quebec Immigration Regulation).\n\nRequirement of the attestation of issuance of a Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ)\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe [CAQ](https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/work-quebec/temporary-workers/temporary-foreign-worker-program/authorizations/application-temporary-selection) is issued by the MIFI only for foreign nationals whose employment requires an LMIA.\n\nAs of December 11, 2023, the MIFI is no longer issuing a paper confirmation letter of the CAQ to temporary foreign workers. Instead, the MIFI is now issuing an online attestation of issuance of a CAQ. Certain applicants (such as applicants under the agriculture stream and in-home caregivers) will receive the attestation by mail until the online option is implemented.\n\nOfficers should continue to accept the old version of the CAQ issued before December 11, 2023. On August 2, 2018, the MIFI introduced a new CAQ that no longer has validity dates. The expiry date was replaced by a duration period, in months. The CAQ becomes effective at the time the work permit is issued. This modification was made to ensure the work permit can be issued for the full duration of the employment specified on the LMIA and CAQ.\n\nPer section 105 of the Quebec Immigration Regulation, the MIFI Minister’s consent for a foreign national’s stay, given under section 5 of this Regulation, is valid for the duration provided for in the positive assessment of the impact on Quebec’s labour market, up to a maximum of 36 months.\n\nThe start of the period provided for in the Quebec Immigration Regulation takes effect on the date the work permit is issued, under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) (SC, 2001, C. 27).\n\n**Note:** To extend a CAQ, a job offer must be reconfirmed by the [MIFI](https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/work-quebec/temporary-workers/temporary-foreign-worker-program/renewing-authorizations).\n\nInternational Mobility Program (IMP)\n------------------------------------\n\nForeign nationals who are coming to work in Quebec under the IMP do **not** require a CAQ.\n\nThe following program delivery instructions (PDIs) are available for specific LMIA exemptions applicable to Quebec applicants:\n\n* [Specific Quebec Selection Certificate (CSQ) holders **currently in Quebec** [R205(a) – A73]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/quebec-cases/labour-market-impact-assessment-exempt-work-permit-renewals-extensions-certain-quebec-selection-holders.html)\n* [Bridging open work permits (BWOPs) for certain economic class permanent residence applicants [R205(a) – A75]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/provincial-nominees-permanent-resident-applicants/bridging-open-work-permits.html)\n* [Quebec Selection Certificate (CSQ) holders **currently outside Quebec** [R205(a) – A76]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/quebec-cases/csq-outside-quebec.html)\n* [Comparison table of categories that are available under the International Mobility Program (IMP) for Quebec Selection Certificate (CSQ) holders (PDF, 629 KB)](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/documents/pdf/english/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/04.comparison-table-of-categories-that-are-available-under-the-international-mobility-program-for-quebec-selection-certificate-(csq)-holders_en.pdf)\n* [Foreign physicians coming to work in Quebec [R205(a) – C10]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/quebec-cases/quebec-physicians.html)\n* [Provincial business candidates or Quebec self-employed applicants approved for a Quebec Selection Certificate (CSQ) seeking eventual permanent residence [R205(a) – C60]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/canadian-interests-significant-benefit-entrepreneurs-self-employed-candidates-seeking-operate-business-r205-c11.html)\n* [Quebec investors – Issuance of open work permits to candidates who have received Notice of Intent to Select from Quebec [R204(c) – T10]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/foreign-workers/quebec-cases-program.html)\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2024-02-27",
