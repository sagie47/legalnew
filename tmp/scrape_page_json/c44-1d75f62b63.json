For post-doctoral fellows who are employed by a Canadian entity that is not an educational institution, their field of specialization should be used. For example, a geologist with a doctorate may work as a geologist and not as a post-doctoral fellow, in which case the NOC code would be 21102 – Geoscientist and oceanographers. |\n| Duties | These are the activities that the foreign national will be performing. Do they align with the occupation and what is described in the [National Occupational Classification](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/)? |\n| Job Requirements | Are there specific requirements that align with the exemption? For example, they must hold a PhD and must have studied in the field of the occupation. |\n| Minimum Education Requirements | A PhD is required or an advanced level of education that a PhD will soon be obtained. |\n\nWork permit issuance in GCMS\n----------------------------\n\nUnder the Application screen, officers should enter the following information in the specified fields:\n\n| Field | Selection or input |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case type | 52 – Employer-specific LMIA-exempt applications *Use the proper Case type – for the application |\n| Province of destination | The province of destination entered by the applicant should match the address of employment in the LMIA-exempt offer of employment.
