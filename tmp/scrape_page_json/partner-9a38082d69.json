At the time of application submission, they must have already been authorized to enter Canada as a temporary resident under [section A22](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-22.html).\n\nDocumentary evidence\n--------------------\n\nWith the application for an open work permit, officers should be satisfied that they have the following documentary evidence to make an assessment:\n\n* proof of relationship (for example, marriage certificate, Statutory Declaration of Common-Law Union [IMM 5409], birth certificate of a common child that shows both parents’ names)\n* a copy of the acknowledgement of receipt (AoR) letter confirming that the permanent residence application has been put into processing \n**Exception:** To ensure that foreign nationals do not fall out of status while awaiting for their AoR, IRCC will allow the applicant to submit their open work permit application without the AoR if they provide proof that\n\n * their work permit, study permit, or temporary resident status expires in 2 weeks or less\n * they have submitted a permanent residence application under the SCLPC class or in the family class as a spouse, common-law or conjugal partner\n\n* proof that they have a valid temporary resident status (for example, a valid work permit, visitor record, study permit, temporary resident permit, or a stamp in their passport)\n* have the same residential address as their sponsor in Canada\n\nIn addition, dependent children must provide\n\n* a copy of the IMM 0008 form for the permanent residence application in which the principal applicant listed the name of their family members\n\nReceipt of application\n----------------------\n\nAll applications must be submitted online unless the applicant is exempt under sections R9.4 or R9.5.\n\n### Paper application\n\nIf the work permit applicant meets one of the exemptions under section R9.4 or R9.5 (for example, if they require accommodations under section R9.5, including for a disability), they can submit the work permit application in another format (paper, braille or large print) after meeting the requirement of a complete permanent resident application as per[section R10](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-10.html).\n\n### Permanent Residence Portal\n\nAn open work permit application submitted in the Permanent Residence Portal is not eligible under this public policy.\n\nIf the work permit application is submitted in the Permanent Residence Portal, officers should send a letter to the applicant asking them to apply online using the correct online application method for an open work permit **after** they receive an AoR.\n\nAssessing the application\n-------------------------\n\nProcessing officers will ensure that the requirements for the open work permit are met.\n\nSince the only assessment on the permanent resident application was to confirm that it is complete, officers assessing the work permit application should conduct system checks to identify any adverse information, on either the sponsor or the applicant, that would render the applicant ineligible for permanent residence and thus the work permit in this category.\n\nIf there is information that an applicant is inadmissible, the admissibility assessment should be completed before a final decision on the work permit application is made.\n\nIn situations where a temporary resident permit is issued to the applicant to overcome an inadmissibility and where the person is an applicant for permanent residence under the SCLPC class, they may be issued an open work permit under this public policy, or they may meet the requirements under a labour market impact assessment(LMIA) exemption. See[International Mobility Program [IMP]: Humanitarian reasons [R208]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/humanitarian-reasons-r208.html).\n\n### Genuine relationship\n\nAs per[section R4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-4.html), a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse or a common-law partner or a conjugal partner of a person if the marriage, common-law partnership or conjugal partnership either\n\n* was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the IRPA, or\n* is not genuine\n\nIf officers have concerns as to the genuineness of the relationship, they may request further documentation or information to confirm that the relationship between the dependent spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner and the principal foreign national is genuine and is not a relationship of convenience.\n\nOfficers can review the guidance in[Assessing the relationship of spouses, common-law and conjugal partners](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/non-economic-classes/family-class-determining-spouse.html#assessingRelationship) for further information.\n\n### Dependent children and working age\n\nThere is no set minimum age to be eligible for a work permit. The submission of work permit applications on behalf of minor children is at the discretion of their parent(s) or authorized guardian(s).\n\nThe \"working age\" varies across provincial and territorial jurisdictions and there is no minimum age for work permit issuance specified in the IRPA or the IRPR.\n\nAs such, unless there are reasonable grounds for an officer to be satisfied that a dependent child is unable to perform the work sought or any other reasons for refusal, minors may be issued a work permit.\n\nPlease refer to the instructions on [Who qualifies as a dependent child](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/non-economic-classes/dependent-children.html#assessing_dependent_children) to confirm if an applicant meets the definition of a dependent child in relation to the principal applicant.\n\nThe age of a dependent child is [locked in](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/non-economic-classes/dependent-children.html#age) when IRCC receives the SCLPC class or the family class application.\n\nFinal decision\n--------------\n\n### Approval\n\nIf the work permit application is approved under this public policy, on the Application screen, officers should enter the following information in the specified fields:\n\n| Field | Selection or input |\n| --- | --- |\n| Case type | 27 |\n| Special program code | For SCLPC class applicants: SPO (sponsored spouse or partner) For family class sponsored spouses or partners: * **Code: FC1-OWP-PP** * **Description: OWP-Family Class in Can PP** |\n| Province of destination | Unknown or open |\n| Exemption code | A74 |\n| Employer | Open |\n| Intended occupation | Open |\n| National Occupational Classification (NOC) | 99999 |\n| Duration | The open work permit may be issued for a maximum period of 24 months or the date the applicant’s passport expires, whichever comes first. |\n| Conditions | Officers should ensure that instructions provided in [Medical conditions to be imposed for open employer but occupation-restricted work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html#conditions-restricted) are followed. |\n| **User remarks (mandatory)** | The following remark must be added to all open work permits: **For spousal:** “Pending SCLPC APR” or “Pending FC APR” **For dependent children only:** Authorized to work as per applicable Canadian federal, provincial and territorial labour laws |\n| Fees | $155 work permit processing fee $100 open work permit holder fee |\n| Biometrics | Work permit applicants are required to provide biometric information and pay the biometric fee ($85). The regular biometric exemptions apply (for example, under 14 or 1 in 10 rule). |\n\n### Refusal and refunds\n\nIf the decision is to refuse the application, the processing officer must state in a case note their logical, reasonable conclusions. Officers can follow the instructions provided in [Decision-making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html).\n\n**For example:**\n\nI am not satisfied that there is a genuine spousal relationship for the following reasons (include all concerns).\n\n**Refund**\n\nThe associated work permit processing fee is not refunded. However, the open work permit holder fee **must** be refunded where an application is refused.\n\nExtensions\n----------\n\nIf the application for permanent residence remains in processing and no eligibility decision has been made on the SCLPC application or no final decision has been made on the application for permanent residence under the family class, the work permit holders are eligible to extend their work permit under the administrative code A74 for 2 additional years under the public policy. This option applies to SCLPC class and family class applicants.\n\n**Note:** If the SCLPC applicants received an approval in principle letter (meaning that they met the eligibility requirement of the class and still have valid status in Canada), they are eligible to apply for an open work permit under section R207 of the IRPR, administrative code [A70](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/applicants-canada.html).
