It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nFees and exceptions related to temporary resident visas(TRVs) and electronic travel authorizations(eTAs).\n\nOn this page\n------------\n\n* [Fees: TRVs](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/immigration/temporary-resident-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-applications-fees.html#fees-TRVs)\n* [Fees: eTAs](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/immigration/temporary-resident-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-applications-fees.html#fees-eTAs)\n* [Study and work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/immigration/temporary-resident-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-applications-fees.html#study)\n* [Performing artists](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/immigration/temporary-resident-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-applications-fees.html#performing)\n* [Diplomatic exemptions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/immigration/temporary-resident-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-applications-fees.html#diplomatic)\n* [Courtesy visas](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/immigration/temporary-resident-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-applications-fees.html#courtesy)\n* [Special authorization (formerly facilitation visa)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/immigration/temporary-resident-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-applications-fees.html#faciliation)\n\nFees: TRVs\n----------\n\n### Processing and collection of fees\n\n* $100 individual – multiple or single entry [[subsection R296(1)]](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-296.html)\n* $500 maximum fee for a family – single or multiple entry [subsection R296(3)]\n* [Fee schedule](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/schedule.html)\n\nFor the purposes of determining eligibility for the maximum fee, [subsection 1(3) and section 2](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/page-1.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) define “family member” and “dependent child” respectively.\n\n**Fee exemptions:** Refer to the Cost Recovery Exemption Code Manual.\n\nFees: eTAs\n----------\n\nThe eTA processing fee is CAN$7 [subsection [R294.1(1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-294.1.html)]. The fee must be paid at the time the application is completed and is required before the application can be submitted. Once the eTA is issued, the applicant will only have to pay this fee again when they need to apply for another eTA, which in most cases will not be for 5 years. There are no eTA fee exemptions.\n\nStudy and work permits\n----------------------\n\nA fee for a TRV will not be collected in cases where an applicant (other than members of a performing artists group) is also applying for either a study permit or a work permit at the same time and place. The fee collected will be for the processing of the study or work permit only.\n\nA foreign national requiring an eTA who is approved for a work or study permit will be issued their eTA at the same time as their work or study permit; they will not be required to pay the CAN$7 processing fee [R294.1(2)].\n\n**Note:** Foreign nationals from the eTA expansion countries will receive a TRV upon the issuance of their initial study or work permit overseas. When these same clients are issued a renewed study or work permit, they will be issued an eTA.\n\nPerforming artists\n------------------\n\nIf the applicant is in a group of performing artists, the TRV fee must be paid in addition to the work permit group fee. (Refer to the procedures in [Work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/immigration/work-permit-r196-r299-1.html).)\n\nDiplomatic exemptions\n---------------------\n\nPlease refer to the [instructions on diplomatic or official TRVs](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/diplomatic-official-visas.html) for guidance on the issuance of diplomatic or official TRVs.\n\nParagraph [R296(2)(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-296.html) provides a TRV fee exemption for diplomats and similar official representatives. Although the IRPR does not define what a “properly accredited diplomat, consular officer, representative or official” of a country is, there are several factors that can act as a guide in assessing such cases.\n\nThe type of passport held is not a reliable guide in determining if a fee exemption applies.\n\nMany countries allow diplomats who are not accredited to retain their diplomatic documents and in some cases, diplomatic passports are issued to non-governmental individuals to facilitate their movement.\n\nOfficers abroad should be guided by normal Canadian practice in accordance with exemptions to cost recovery regulations. As the receiving country accords diplomatic status or privilege, so the receiving country also determines the courtesies to be extended, irrespective of the passport held. The normal practice would be to consult the [list of individuals and officials](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadian-passports/official-travel/special-diplomatic-adults/apply-who.html) who, in the Canadian context, would be entitled to a diplomatic or special passport and to accord the appropriate status to comparable individuals or officials, irrespective of the passport held.\n\nAccordingly, where a person would, in the Canadian context, be eligible for a diplomatic or official passport, consideration should be given to exempting the person from the cost recovery charges in accordance with paragraph R296(2)(a).\n\nCourtesy visas\n--------------\n\nAs far as fees are concerned, no distinction is made between courtesy visas and other visas. Unless the applicant is fee exempt as per subsection R296(2), the fees are charged at the appropriate rate.\n\nSpecial authorization (formerly facilitation visa)\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThere is no fee associated with a [special authorization](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/dual-canadian-citizens-visit-canada.html#findOut).\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2024-11-29",
