It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nThis summary contains links that may be useful for officers assessing applications from foreign nationals who wish to work as interns in Canada. The intention is to provide officers with a list of the most common scenarios under which foreign nationals apply as interns and what they require.\n\nThe term “internship” is not defined in the _Immigration and Refugee Protection Act_(IRPA) or its Regulations. Internships constitute [work](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/what-is-work.html), as foreign nationals are considered to be entering the Canadian labour market and to be displacing opportunities for Canadian citizens or permanent residents. This notion applies to internships whether they are pursued in relation to a study program, in a situation where wages are not paid or when a commission is earned.\n\n* [Section 2](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-2.html) of the _Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations_(IRPR) defines work as “an activity for which wages are paid or commission is earned, or that competes directly with activities of Canadian citizens or permanent residents in the Canadian labour market”.\n\n**Note:** See the program delivery instructions for information on [international students](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits.html) enrolled in [designated learning institutions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) in Canada.\n\nAll internships are subject to the following guiding principles:\n\n* Foreign nationals registered at foreign educational institutions (i.e., **not** enrolled in a Canadian [designated learning institution](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html)) and wishing to come to Canada to complete an internship or undertake a position in research programs are considered [temporary foreign workers](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers.html) under the IRPR. Examples include foreign nationals funded by research organizations such as Mitacs.\n* Under the IRPA and IRPR, foreign nationals who seek authorization to [work](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/what-is-work.html) in Canada (whether or not they are remunerated) **must** obtain a **work permit**, unless they are exempt from the requirement pursuant to [section R186](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit.html). \n* Employers of foreign nationals, including interns who are not work permit-exempt under [section R186](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit.html), must obtain a positive [Labour Market Impact Assessment(LMIA)](http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/jobs/foreign_workers/scc.shtml) from [Employment and Social Development Canada(ESDC)](http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/home.shtml), unless they are LMIA-exempt under the IRPR [[R204 to 208](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/page-42.html)]. Even if the employment is LMIA-exempt, employers are required to submit the offer of employment directly to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada(IRCC) and to pay the [employer compliance fee](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/information/fees/index.asp) before the foreign national submits their work permit application.\n\nWhile there is no specific LMIA exemption for interns, the following provides a list of the most common scenarios officers may encounter when assessing interns’ applications. The list is not exhaustive, as other situations may occur.\n\nFor specific requirements or examples, review the information provided in the links.\n\n**Note:** Interns must meet the standard requirements for the LMIA exemption they are seeking, as would any other foreign national.\n\nWork permit and LMIA required\n-----------------------------\n\n* Foreign nationals pursuing an internship in Canada who are not work permit-exempt or LMIA-exempt need a work permit to work in Canada as interns.\n* Prospective Canadian employers of foreign nationals must apply for an LMIA from [ESDC](http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/jobs/foreign_workers/index.shtml) before the foreign national can apply for a work permit, whether or not the internship is remunerated.\n\nIn addition, there are exemptions under the IRPR [[R204-208](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/page-42.html)] that may exempt a foreign national from the requirement to obtain an LMIA.

In addition, the individual or the Canadian institution must not receive remuneration for the research.\n\n* [Health care students](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/authorization-work-without-work-permit-health-care-students.html) – paragraph R186(p) \nAllows foreign students registered at foreign educational institutions outside Canada to do their clinical clerkships or short-term practicums in Canada.\n\nApplicants destined to Quebec\n-----------------------------\n\nForeign nationals destined to work in Quebec under the [sections R204 to R208](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/page-42.html) (LMIA exemptions) do not require a Quebec Acceptance Certificate(CAQ).\n\nWork permit issuance in the Global Case Management System(GCMS)\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nUnder the _Application_ screen, officers should enter the following:\n\n* _Case Type_: as per the applicable LMIA exemption code, NES (not elsewhere specified)\n\nBased on fields in the _Offer of Employment_, officers should enter the following under the _Application_ screen:\n\n* _Province of Destination_: address of physical job location \n * If there is more than one location, enter the primary location in the _Province of Destination_ field and the secondary location in the _Remarks_ field.\n\n* _City of Destination_: address of physical job location \n * If there is more than one location, enter the primary location in the _City of Destination_ field and the secondary location in the _Remarks_ field.\n\n* _Exemption Code_: as per the applicable LMIA exemption\n* _NOC_: National Occupational Classification code\n* _Intended Occupation_: job title \n* _Salary_: “amount per year” as indicated wage in Canadian dollars and number of work hours\n* _Employer_: business operating name\n\n**Note:** The employer is subject to regulatory imposed conditions based on the information provided in the _Offer of Employment_. Therefore, any corrections to the information in the form **must** come from the employer.\n\nSpecifically, if the employer has made an error in the _Offer of Employment_, officers should not correct the information in GCMS.
