The work cannot form more than 50% of the total program of study.\n\nThe acceptance letter provided by the [DLI](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/designated-learning-institutions.html) should clearly establish that the work is an essential part of the academic, vocational or professional training program that all participants enrolled in the program are required to complete in order to receive their degree, diploma or certificate. The most common example is undergraduate co-op programs at universities and colleges.\n\n**Outside Canada**\n\nStudents who are outside Canada can work while their study permit and co-op work permit are being processed. If their school and employer agree, they can either\n\n* accept a Canadian work placement and begin working remotely from their home country, or\n* work for a company in their home country\n\n**In Canada**\n\nStudents who are already in Canada and have applied for a co-op work permit may begin their co-op placement using their [on-campus](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/working-on-campus.html) and [off-campus](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/campus-work.html) work authorization, provided they meet all the eligibility requirements.\n\nThere is no limit on work hours for on-campus work. A student may accept employment on the campus of the university or college at which they are a full-time student under [paragraph R186(f)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html).\n\nFor off-campus work authorization, as per [paragraph R186(v)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html), students can work a total of 24 hours per week during an academic term or semester while they are waiting for their co-op work permit; however, the 24 hours must include both the hours worked at their co-op job and those worked at their regular paid job (if they have one). They can work full-time during the [regularly scheduled breaks](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/campus-work.html#definitions).\n\nIf the co-op work permit application is refused, they cannot exceed the off-campus work authorization limit of 24 hours per week.\n\n### Issuing a post-secondary co-op work permit (C32)\n\n**Note:** All co-op work permits are open work permits.\n\nOfficers should code the unrestricted occupation open work permits in the Global Case Management System (GCMS) as per the following:\n\n* Employer name: DLI\n* Location: Unspecified or unknown\n* Fee exemption code: E02\n* Occupation: NOC 99999 (no other code should be used)\n\n#### Conditions in GCMS to be entered by officers in Canada\n\nOfficers must enter **both** of the following **conditions**:\n\n* **condition 18** (“must leave Canada by”)\n* **condition 26** (“not valid for employment in businesses related to the sex trade, such as strip clubs, massage parlours and escort services”)\n\nIf a medical examination has **not** been completed, the condition or conditions below **must** be imposed. The specific occupational sector restriction depends on whether the person has resided in a [designated or non-designated country](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents/country-requirements.html).\n\n* For people from n**on-designated** countries, the following condition should appear on the work permit: “Not authorized to work in 1) child care, 2) primary or secondary school teaching, 3) health services field occupations” (condition 15).\n* For people from **designated** countries, the following conditions should appear on the work permit: \n * “Not authorized to work in 1) child care, 2) primary or secondary school teaching, 3) health services field occupations” (**condition 15**)\n * “Not authorized to work in agricultural occupations” (**condition 16**)\n\n**Do not select condition 21, “Not authorized to work for any employer other than stated”.**\n\nApplicants whose work permit includes **condition 21** are able to work for co-op participating employers. If this condition causes an issue to the DLI or employer, they may submit a [request for a change to the conditions of their work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/extend.html) to have this condition removed.\n\nOfficers must copy and paste the following remark into the User Remarks field in GCMS: “Employment practicum cannot form more than 50% of the total program of study. Authorized to undertake employment which forms integral part of studies as certified by the institution.”\n\nIn cases where several work periods are necessary throughout the academic course (for example, 5 work terms and 8 study terms for a degree), the work permit should be valid for the same period as the study permit.\n\n**Note:** This provision applies only to work that is required for a program offered by a Canadian institution. Exemption code C32 does **not** apply if the employment is a requirement of an academic, vocational or professional training program offered by a foreign institution.\n\nSecondary school co-op – Exemption code C33 eligibility\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nExemption code C33 (co-op for international secondary school students) is intended for study permit holders who intend to perform work that is an essential part of a Canadian program at the secondary school level. This includes vocational training programs offered by a DLI in Quebec and programs that require students to work in order to obtain their secondary or high school diploma or certificate of graduation.\n\n**Note:** For the purpose of subparagraphs R205(c)(i.1) and (i.2) (**exemption codes C32 and C33**), students are not eligible if they undertake any of the following:\n\n* general interest courses\n* preparatory courses\n* work-study programs offered by institutions that primarily offer English or French as a second language (ESL/FSL) courses\n* business-type programs containing primarily ESL/FSL courses (officers may request more information regarding the curriculum directly from the school before finalizing the application)\n\nApplicants under exemption codes C31, C32 or C33 are exempt from the work permit processing fee [[R299(2)(e)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-299.html)] and the open work permit fee [[R303.2(2)(a)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-303.2.html)].\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2025-11-10",
