It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nAll foreign nationals seeking entry to Canada must be able to satisfy an officer at the POE or an officer at CPC-V that they have a genuine purpose for wishing to come into or remain in Canada.\n\nThis can be accomplished by providing:\n\n* an invitation letter (which can be verified) from the family/friends/colleagues to be visited in Canada, outlining the reason and length of the visit;\n* contact numbers for persons who may be able to substantiate the stated purpose for coming or remaining in Canada; and\n* any other documentation that may substantiate the purpose.\n\nLetter of Invitation\n--------------------\n\nIn some cases a person applying for a TRV may be asked to provide a [letter of invitation from someone in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/letter-invitation.html) who is either a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident. A letter of invitation does not guarantee that a visa will be issued. Visa officers assess **the applicant** to determine whether they meet the requirements of the _Immigration and Refugee Protection Act_(IRPA) and to ensure that they are a bona fide visitor.\n\nLetters of invitation should be provided in good faith even though persons in Canada who provide such a document are not legally responsible for the visitor once they arrive. The host must provide truthful information and have the intention to carry out the promises they made in the letter. Some visa offices may require that this letter be notarized. Clients should therefore check with the visa office for specific instructions.\n\nThe letter of invitation should be sent to the person being invited to Canada, who will include it with the TRV application, and must contain the following information about:\n\n| The person being invited | The person inviting the foreign national |\n| --- | --- |\n| * complete name; * date of birth; * the address and telephone number; * the relationship with the person being invited; * the purpose of the trip; * length of intended stay in Canada; * details on accommodation and living expenses; and * the intended date of departure from Canada. | * complete name; * date of birth; * address and telephone number in Canada; * occupation; * whether they are a Canadian citizen or permanent resident; and * a photocopy of a document proving their status in Canada. |\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2017-11-06",
