This may require demonstrating certain procedures. The demonstration must not result in the completion of an [installation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#i1) or servicing task, or of part of such task, or in the productive operation of the equipment or machinery.\n\nThe CETA **does not** relieve after-sales or after-lease service personnel, or any other business person, from the obligation to comply with municipal, regional, provincial/territorial, or other federal requirements, where applicable.\n\n### Work that does not meet the eligibility requirements of after-sales or after-lease service\n\nPersons whose activities or services in Canada would constitute hands-on building and construction work may **not** enter under [R186(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) and CETA as after-sales or after-lease service.\n\nGenerally the entry of foreign tradespersons in the building and construction industry is subject to an assessment of the availability of domestic labour (an LMIA). As part of the LMIA process, Service Canada will consult with organized labour prior to making a determination.\n\nFor personnel performing the installation or servicing, entry should not be granted when performing hands-on building and construction work. The performance of these activities is not permitted, regardless of wording in sales, warranty or service agreements supporting they be completed.\n\n**Building and construction work:** includes installing, maintaining, and repairing utility services, any part of the fabric of any building or structure, or machinery, equipment, or structures within a building.\n\nBuilding and construction work includes activities normally performed by (but not limited to):\n\n* labourers;\n* millwrights;\n* heat and frost insulators;\n* bricklayers;\n* carpenters and joiners;\n* electrical workers;\n* operating engineers (includes heavy equipment operators);\n* elevator constructors;\n* sheet metal workers;\n* teamsters;\n* boilermakers;\n* residential, commercial, or industrial painters (including the application of all service coatings no matter how applied);\n* bridge, structural, and ornamental ironworkers;\n* plumbers and pipefitters;\n* roofers;\n* plasterers and cement masons.\n\nBuilding and construction work includes work involving:\n\n* assembly lines;\n* conveyor belts and systems;\n* overhead cranes;\n* heating, cooling, and ventilation or exhaust systems;\n* elevators and escalators;\n* boilers and turbines; and\n* dismantling or demolition of commercial or industrial equipment or machinery whether on-site or in-plant.\n\nDocumentary evidence\n--------------------\n\nA business visitor under CETA must provide the following documentation:\n\n* proof of citizen of a [European Union member state](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/countries_en),\n* documentation to support the purpose for entry (must be a business activity listed in [Annex 10-D](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/text-texte/10-A.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Annex%2010%2DD%20%E2%80%93%20Activities%20of%20short%20term%20business%20visitors) of the CETA),\n* need to be employed by an enterprise other than a non-profit organisation, and\n* evidence that the business activity is international in scope and that the they are not attempting to enter the Canadian labour market, \n * the primary source of remuneration is outside Canada, and\n * the person’s place of business remains outside Canada and the profits of the business are accumulated primarily outside Canada.\n\nIn general, an individual who is to be paid in Canada would be considered to be joining the labour market and could not be authorized to enter Canada as a business visitor. The payment of expenses incidental to the trip is allowed, as is an honorarium. There are scenarios and country specific situations which require the need for an economic needs test and a work permit is required. Refer to the [Annex 10-D](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/text-texte/10-A.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Annex%2010%2DD%20%E2%80%93%20Activities%20of%20short%20term%20business%20visitors) of the CETA for reservations and exceptions applying in specific member states of the European union for key personnel and short term business visitors.\n\nOral declaration as to the principal place of business and the actual place of accrual of profits can be used as documentary evidence. If further proof is requested, a letter from the employer or the representing organization is sufficient. Prior approval procedures, labour certification tests, or other similar procedures cannot be required. Every effort should be made to avoid the requirement of a visa.\n\n### Documentary evidence for after-sales or after-lease service\n\nBusiness visitors applying under the after-sales or after-lease service provision of [Annex 10-D](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/text-texte/10-A.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Annex%2010%2DD%20%E2%80%93%20Activities%20of%20short%20term%20business%20visitors) of the CETA should be referred for a secondary examination when seeking entry, due to the complexity of the application and for reasons of client service and program consistency.\n\nThe following documentation is required:\n\n* proof of [EU citizenship](https://european-union.europa.eu/principles-countries-history/eu-countries_en); and\n* copies of the original sales or lease agreement, and warranty or service agreement, including extensions, which clearly support the purpose of entry.\n\nThe warranty or service contract must be incidental to, or connected to the sale or lease of commercial or industrial equipment or machinery, including computer software.\n\nThe warranty or service agreement does not need to have the same date as the sales or lease agreement. Particularly with third party service as it may take a number of months after the sale before the company installing or servicing the machinery is identified and sub-contracted.\n\nThe initial warranty or service agreement may be extended provided that the sales or lease agreement, or initial warranty or service agreement contained a provision allowing for the extension. The after-sales or after-lease service, therefore, continues to be contracted as part of the sale or lease of the equipment or machinery, or computer software.\n\n### Third party service\n\nIf [third party service](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#t3) occurs, there must be clear wording in the sales or lease agreement that specifies a third party will perform the installation, warranty, or service work. Unless such wording exists, there is no evidence that the third party service is incidental to the sale or lease. However, the firm need not be named in the agreement, as it may take some time for the firm to be identified. When a third party is not named in the sales or lease agreement, business visitors may be expected to provide a letter from the seller of the equipment that identifies them as the third party referenced in the original sales or lease agreement.\n\nWhen a seller or lessor located in the EU contracts the after-sales or after-lease servicing to a third party, the third party must also be established in the EU.\n\n### Lack of Documentation\n\nEvery effort should be made to allow documentation to be provided (e.g., by fax, email or verbal explanation) from the company in Canada or the business visitor’s employer in the EU.\n\nThe requirement for documentation has been imposed in order to clearly establish that the proposed activity is incidental or connected to the sale or lease of the equipment or machinery or computer software.\n\nA verbal statement that the business of the applicant is being carried on outside Canada can be acceptable. Alternative indications (business cards, business papers, advertising pamphlets, etc.) may be helpful.\n\nFinal decision\n--------------\n\n### Maximum length of stay for CETA business visitors\n\nIn most cases, the maximum length of stay for short-term business visitors and business visitors for investment purposes is 90 days in any 6 month period, if the applicant does not qualify under R186(a).\n\nOfficers may refer to the specific country reservations and exceptions in [Annex 10-B – Reservations and exceptions applying in specific member states of the European union for key personnel and short term business visitors](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/text-texte/10-A.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Annex%2010%2DB%20%E2%80%93%20Reservations%20and%20exceptions%20applying%20in%20specific%20member%20states%20of%20the%20european%20union%20for%20key%20personnel%20and%20short%20term%20business%20visitors).\n\n### Visitor record\n\nAll CETA business visitors may seek entry to Canada for a number of regular visits related to a specific project. These visits may take place over a period of weeks or months. In these circumstances, consideration should be given to issuing a [visitor record](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/visitor-record.html) to reduce potential referrals to immigration secondary.\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2024-10-03",
