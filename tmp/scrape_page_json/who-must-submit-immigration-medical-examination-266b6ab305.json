They are not required to repeat the medical exam if the previous exam has expired. If the IME has expired, the responsible migration office must request a reassessment from the responsible regional medical office (RMO) to proceed with finalizing the permanent residence application.\n\nTemporary residence applicants\n------------------------------\n\nForeign nationals who are applying for a temporary resident visa (TRV) or applying to remain in Canada as a temporary resident may be required to undergo an IME under [subparagraph R30(1)(a)(i)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-30.html).

This list is not exhaustive.\n\n* Occupational settings that bring the applicant in close contact with people, namely\n * workers in health care settings\n * clinical laboratory workers\n * patient attendants in nursing and geriatric homes\n * medical students admitted to Canada to attend university\n * medical electives and physicians on short-term locums\n * workers in primary and secondary school settings and workers in child-care settings\n * domestic workers\n * workers who give in-home care to children, the elderly and the disabled\n * daycare employees\n * agricultural workers from designated countries or territories.\n * A country or a territory is designated if there is a \"Yes\" in the column entitled \"Immigration medical examination required\" in the [designated country and territory list](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents/country-requirements.html).\n\n### If the duration of the visit is more than 6 months\n\nIn the calculation of whether a stay will exceed 6 months, real or planned absences from Canada of less than 14 days do not affect the determination.\n\nAn IME is required for\n\n* applicants who are seeking to work in occupational settings in which the protection of public health is essential\n * The following examples are not exhaustive:\n * workers in health care settings\n * clinical laboratory workers\n * patient attendants in nursing and geriatric homes\n * medical students admitted to Canada to attend university\n * medical electives and physicians on short-term locums\n * workers in primary and secondary school settings and workers in child-care settings\n * domestic workers\n * workers who give in-home care to children, the elderly and the disabled\n * daycare employees\n\n**Reminder:**For work in these settings, an IME is required regardless of**length of stay**.\n\n* persons who, in the one-year period before they seek entry to Canada or apply for a visa or permit, have spent more than 6 consecutive months in a [country](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents/country-requirements.html) for which an IME is required.\n* students (except medical and health care students) do not need an IME unless they are from a **country**that requires an IME.\n\n### Work permit applicants under International Experience Canada(IEC)\n\n* All International Experience Canada (IEC) applicants, regardless of nationality, must undergo an IME if they plan to work in a [designated setting](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html), regardless of the duration of their work permit. IEC applicants must also undergo an IME if they have lived or travelled in [certain countries or territories](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents/country-requirements.html) for 6 months or more and plan to work or reside in Canada for more than 6 months.\n* Applicants planning to work in specific occupations involving close contact with vulnerable population must always undergo an [IME](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html).\n* Applicants who completed their IME must upload the eMedical “Information Sheet” provided by their panel physician (or the signed IMM 1017B for paper files) into the “Proof of Medical Examination” or “Optional Documents” slot. Applicants applying on paper must attach the document to their application.\n* To prevent applicants’ medical results from expiring before they have received an invitation to apply (ITA), they should be encouraged to wait until they receive their ITA before proceeding with an IME.\n* Applicants who require an [IME](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html), but are unable to get one within the 20-day deadline, may submit proof, with their work permit application, that they have scheduled an appointment with a [panel physician approved by IRCC](https://ircc.canada.ca/pp-md/pp-list.aspx).

For an officer to be satisfied that payment for the treatment is guaranteed and that it will not displace Canadians awaiting treatment, a medical officer should be consulted before a decision is made. Airlines carrying such individuals may need to be informed of the nature of the condition and officers should advise the temporary resident to notify the airline before travel to avoid complications during travel.\n\nRefugee claimants\n-----------------\n\n* Foreign nationals who claim refugee protection in Canada [[R30(1)(a)(v)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-30.html)].\n* Foreign nationals who are seeking to enter or remain in Canada and who may apply to the minister for protection under subsection [A112(1)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-112.html), other than foreign nationals who have not left Canada since their claim for refugee protection or application for protection was rejected [R30(1)(a)(vi)].\n* Refugee claimants and the members of their family in Canada must **hold a valid medical certificate before** they can be permitted to work in Canada and in order to finalize the refugee application.\n * See [Applicants with no other means of support [R206]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/applicants-no-other-means-support-r206.html).\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2024-07-26",
