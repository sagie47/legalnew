A no-objection note (bilateral mission) or letter (multilateral mission) from the XDC must be submitted with the work permit application. The application should be submitted in Canada to the case processing centre.\n\nIf the in-Canada applicant cannot produce a note or letter of no-objection from the XDC, the employer-specific work permit application can be refused pursuant to [paragraph R199(i)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-199.html).\n\nIRCC officers may consult the XDC if they receive a work permit application to work at a mission to ensure that the mission or consular post has permission to hire. IRCC officers are not required to consult the XDC in cases of work permit renewals with the same employer. The XDC issues an initial note or letter of no objection, but does not do so for extensions. If IRCC officers have any concerns when assessing renewals, they may contact the XDC.\n\nLocally engaged staff are not granted official status, nor are they granted any immunities, privileges or benefits under the provisions of the Vienna Conventions or the Government of Canada’s Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act.\n\n**Note:** Generally, the XDC will not provide a no-objection note or letter for persons in Canada who have entered Canada for the intended purpose of working as locally engaged employees of bilateral and multilateral missions. Applicants must already have entered Canada and usually hold an open work permit.\n\nProcessing instructions for in-Canada applicants\n------------------------------------------------\n\n* Persons wishing to work as locally engaged staff **must** submit a copy of the no-objection note or letter from the XDC. If a no-objection note or letter is submitted, officers may consult with the XDC before making a decision on the work permit application. Applicants must satisfy all the criteria of a temporary resident.\n* Applicants may apply from within Canada, pursuant to [paragraph R199(i)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-199.html).\n* A work permit that is exempt from a LMIA may be issued, pursuant to [section R205](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-205.html) (C20). The foreign mission or international organization is noted as the employer.\n\nEmployer compliance exemption\n-----------------------------\n\nDiplomatic and consular missions are [exempt from the employer compliance regime](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/compliance-exempt-employers.html).\n\nThe foreign national must provide all the documentary evidence to satisfy the officer that they meet the requirements for an LMIA exemption under exemption code C20 as locally engaged staff at a foreign mission or international organization in Canada.\n\nDocumentary evidence includes both of the following documents:\n\n* written confirmation (for instance, an employment contract) from the mission or international organization attesting to the details of the work as locally engaged staff\n* a letter of no objection from GAC\n\nWork permit issuance in the Global Case Management System(GCMS)\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGCMS will not require an LMIA exemption number (A#) to be entered. Although the employer is exempt from paying the employer compliance fee, the system will still expect the fee to be paid. The processing officers must manually enter **fee exemption code “EC1.”**\n\nBecause the work permit type “Other” was selected on the work permit application, GCMS automatically defaults to case type 20. The officers must manually change the case type to the new case type 60 under the “Application” screen.\n\nBased on the employment contract or other documentation submitted with the work permit application, officers should enter the following under the “Application” screen:\n\n* Province of Destination: Address of physical job location\n* City of Destination: Address of physical job location (if there is more than one location (province and/or city), officers should enter the primary location in the “City/Province of Destination” field and the other location(s) in the “Remarks” field)\n* Exemption Code: C20\n* Intended Occupation: Job title\n* Salary: Amount per year as indicated in the employment contract.\n* Employer: Name of the mission or international organization\n\nApplicants destined to Quebec\n-----------------------------\n\nForeign nationals destined to work in Quebec under [sections R204 to 208](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/page-39.html#docCont) (LMIA exemptions) do not require a Quebec Acceptance Certificate.\n\n### Situations of foreign nationals outside Canada applying as LES\n\nA no-objection note or letter will generally not be issued to foreign nationals who apply outside Canada to work as LES at diplomatic missions or consular posts. Applications that are submitted outside Canada should be dealt with on a case-by-case basis engaging the XDC.\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2019-06-04",
