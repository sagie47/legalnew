Entry of family members is governed by the provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and Regulations\n\nCategories of temporary entry\n-----------------------------\n\nThe CCFTA facilitates temporary entry for the following categories of business persons:\n\n### [Business visitors – Work permit exempt under paragraph R186(a)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/canada-chile/business-visitors.html)\n\n* A Chilean business visitor seeking entry to Canada is eligible for consideration under the provisions of the CCFTA, as well as the general provisions which apply to all foreign workers.\n* Business visitors engage in international business activities related to research and design; growth, manufacture and production; marketing; sales; distribution; after-sales service; and general service without the need for a work permit. These activities reflect the components of a business cycle (see [Appendix K-03.I.1](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/chile-chili/fta-ale/03k.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=card%20for%20foreigners.-,Appendix%20K%2D03.I.1,-Business%20Visitors) of the CCFTA for further info).\n\n### [Traders (Administrative code F20)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/canada-chile/traders.html)\n\n* Traders carry on substantial trade in goods or services between Canada and Chile.\n* Traders must be employed in a supervisory or executive capacity or one that involves essential skills.\n\n### [Investors (Administrative code F21)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/canada-chile/investors.html)\n\n* Investors have committed, or are in the process of committing, a substantial amount of capital in Canada.\n* Investors must be employed in a supervisory or executive capacity or one that involves essential skills.\n\n### [Professionals (Administrative code F22)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/canada-chile/professionals.html)\n\n* Professionals are business persons who enter to provide pre-arranged professional services— either as a salaried employee of a Canadian enterprise, through a contract between the business person and a Canadian employer, or through a contract between the Chilean employer of the business person and a Canadian enterprise. As per [Appendix K-03.IV.1](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/chile-chili/fta-ale/03k.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=de%20Extranjer%C3%ADa%22).-,Appendix%20K%2D03.IV.1,-Professionals) of the CCFTA, there are select occupations covered by the Agreement. Professionals enter to provide services in the field for which they are qualified.\n\n### [Intra-company transferees (ICT) - Executives or senior managers or Specialized knowledge workers (Administrative codes F23 or F24)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/canada-chile/transferees.html)\n\n* Are currently employed by a Chilean enterprise in a managerial or executive capacity (TEER 0 or 1), or in one which involves specialized knowledge, and are being transferred to the Canadian enterprise which has a qualifying relationship of parent, branch, subsidiary or affiliate, to provide services in the same capacity.\n\nPlace of application\n--------------------\n\nBusiness visitors are work permit exempt and therefore applications can be made at a port of entry, provided the applicant already has a valid temporary resident visa or electronic travel authorization to allow them to travel to Canada. Applicants must apply for and obtain the [temporary resident visa or electronic travel authorization](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/visit/visas.asp) prior to travelling to Canada.\n\nForeign nationals that are exempt from the requirement for a temporary resident visa may apply for a work permit at the port of entry, as well as foreign nationals who otherwise meet the requirements of R198. For more information, see: [Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) and International Mobility Program (IMP): Persons who may apply at a port of entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/persons-who-may-apply-port-entry.html).\n\nForeign nationals may apply for a work permit from within Canada if they meet the conditions set out in section [R199](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-199.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.\n\nTo ensure a smooth entry to Canada, investors are should be encouraged to submit their work permit application to an IRCC office prior to arrival in Canada.\n\nExtending work permits issued under the agreement\n-------------------------------------------------\n\nThe FTA allows for the extension of work permits originally issued in accordance with the agreement. Work permits may be extended at the discretion of the officer assessing the application, provided that the necessary documentary evidence has been submitted by the applicant to support the request.\n\nTo extend an FTA work permit, the employer must submit a new offer of employment and the applicant must comply with regular work permit extension requirements.\n\nWhen reviewing the duration requested by the employer, officers should examine the application and the offer of employment to ensure that the requirements and purpose of entry under the agreement are still being met. Extension applications under [section R201](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-201.html) should be made online. Applications submitted at a port of entry or at an IRCC office outside of Canada are considered to be new work permit applications under [section R200](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html).\n\nExamples of acceptable documentation to support an extension include the following:\n\n* a service contract extension justification from the offering enterprise\n* updated business plans\n* an offer for a new contract\n* feasibility studies and marketing plans.\n\nDetermining eligibility\n-----------------------\n\nTo determine eligibility, officers should consider the following factors:\n\n* the **intentions** of the applicant \n * What is the applicant doing in Canada?\n * How long has the applicant been here?\n * How long is the request for?\n\n* the **reason given** by the applicant for applying for the extension \n * Are the plans well thought out or merely frivolous?\n * Has the applicant previously received an extension?\n\n* the applicant’s situation in **their home country**\n * What family, employment or other responsibilities and obligations has the person left behind?\n * How have these responsibilities been discharged?\n * Is a prolonged stay in Canada reasonable and feasible?\n\n* the **initial intent** of the application \n * What was the original purpose of the business visit to Canada?\n * Has the original purpose of the business visit been fulfilled?\n * If the original purpose of the business visit has not been fulfilled, was sufficient time originally granted to fulfill the purpose?\n\n* the **necessary licence or documentation** to practise the applicant’s occupation in Canada in instances where an occupation is regulated at a provincial or territorial level \n * For example, in most provinces and territories, electrician and plumber are regulated occupations and require documentation to be practised.\n\nTemporary entry\n---------------\n\nThe FTA defines **“temporary entry”** as “...entry without the intent to establish permanent residence.” This definition is consistent with immigration law. It is adaptable to individual circumstances and it recognizes that the concept of temporary entry cannot be based simply on a specific time limitation.\n\nThe definition does not allow for open-ended temporary entry. The provisions of the agreement cannot be used as a mechanism to circumvent procedures applicable to permanent employment nor as a means to establish de facto permanent residence.\n\nMultiple renewals will not be approved routinely even though a lengthy appointment might have been indicated at the time of arrival in Canada. The longer the duration of temporary stay, the greater the onus will be on the foreign national, especially when requesting an extension of status, to satisfy an officer of temporary intent.\n\nForeign nationals may be authorized to work temporarily in a permanent position that, for one reason or another, is temporarily vacant.\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2024-10-03",

The longer the duration of temporary stay, the greater the onus will be on the foreign national, especially when requesting an extension of status, to satisfy an officer of temporary intent.\n\nForeign nationals may be authorized to work temporarily in a permanent position that, for one reason or another, is temporarily vacant.\n\nPage details\n------------\n\n 2024-10-03"
