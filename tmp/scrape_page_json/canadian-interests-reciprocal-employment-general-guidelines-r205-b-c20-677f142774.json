It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.\n\nEffective immediately, most foreign nationals in Canada are no longer eligible to apply for a work permit at a port of entry.\n\nThe following work permit applications are exempt from the above restrictions and may still be accepted for processing at a port of entry:\n\n* **applicants who are citizens or permanent residents of the United States of America (USA)**\n* **professionals and technicians under free trade agreements (FTAs)**\n * professionals under the FTA with the USA and Mexico (T36)\n * professionals under the FTA with Chile (F22)\n * contractual service suppliers or independent professionals under the FTA with South Korea (F32)\n * professionals under the FTA with Panama (F42)\n * professionals or technicians under the FTA with Colombia (F12)\n * professionals or technicians under the FTA with Peru (F52)\n\n* **spouses or common-law partners**of applicants under the FTAs with South Korea (F32), Panama (F42) and Colombia (F12)\n* **truck drivers** who are required to depart Canada for the purpose of their employment and, prior to their departure from Canada, held a work permit or maintained status as a result of a pending application for work permit renewal (this does not include truck drivers operating solely within Canada)\n* **applicants with pre-scheduled Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) appointments**\n\nParagraph R205(b) allows foreign workers to take up employment in Canada when Canadians have similar reciprocal opportunities abroad. **Entry under reciprocal provisions should result in a neutral labour market impact.**\n\nThere are formally-recognized reciprocal programs such as the International Experience Canada program (see [International Experience Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/international-experience.html)). However this provision also allows for admission of workers in other cases where reciprocity is demonstrated by the Canadian employer (or specific program administrator). Academic institutions may initiate exchanges under C20 as long as they are reciprocal, and licensing and medical requirements (if applicable) are met.\n\nThe onus is on the institutions or applicants to demonstrate that reciprocity exists\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis could be indicated in the exchange agreement between the Canadian and foreign parties, a letter from the receiving Canadian institution, the work contract (if it provides evidence of reciprocity) and, if necessary, the officer can request documents and/or data to enable verification of reciprocal employment volumes. _Bona fide_ evidence of reciprocity will allow the officer to issue a work permit.\n\n**tip**: A useful starting point can be a company’s HR Plan or its “Global Mobility Policy “ within their HR directives, which may provide evidence that an exchange program is in place and, depending on the balance of bilateral flow, may indicate that it is reciprocal in practice.\n\nIt is not necessary that there be exact reciprocity (i.e. one for one exchange), but the general order of magnitude of exchanges should be reasonably similar on an annual basis. In assessing reciprocity, one would consider the relative number and percentage. For example, for exchanges involving larger numbers of foreign nationals (e.g. greater than 25), officers could require a higher minimum proportion of Canadians employed abroad to foreign nationals employed in Canada (e.g. at least 75%) than for smaller exchanges.\n\nWhen the entities involved have no history of conducting reciprocal exchanges with Canada, it is reasonable to initially limit work permits to a small number of individuals and that subsequent work permits be issued only when reciprocity has been demonstrated. When organizations have a demonstrated history of reciprocal exchanges, they may be permitted some flexibility in the flow of exchange on an annual basis, as long as they are able to demonstrate that the exchanges are similar over a reasonable period of time (e.g. five years), there is a general neutral impact on the labour market.\n\nIn assessing reciprocity, officers can consider not only the number of individuals working in Canada and abroad, but also employment duration and job level.\n\nIf evidence of reciprocity is not presented to the satisfaction of the officer, the work permit may be refused, or the applicant may be notified that a labour market impact assessment (LMIA) must be obtained for further consideration of a work permit.\n\nOther examples of C20\n---------------------\n\n### Professional and semi-professional coaches and athletes working for Canadian-based teams\n\nFull or part-time paid coaches and trainers, and professional or semi-professional athletes working for Canadian-based teams require work permits. Given the international mobility in this field, they may be eligible for exemption from an LMIA pursuant to paragraph R205(b), C20, if they can prove that reciprocity exists for the particular occupation in their home country.\n\nA full-time coach is a worker who earns significant income from coaching—enough to support themselves. A part-time coach earns a significant portion towards supporting themselves in Canada.\n\nProfessional Canadian teams, for which foreign athletes would require a work permit, include, but are not limited to, those in\n\n* the National and American Hockey Leagues\n* the Canadian Football League\n* Major League Baseball and its affiliates at the A, AA and AAA levels\n* the National Basketball Association\n* the Canadian Soccer League\n* Major League Soccer\n\n### Cultural agreements\n\nPersons entering Canada to take employment under the terms of cultural agreements between Canada and the following countries: Belgium, Brazil, Germany, Italy, Japan and Mexico. Fee exempt.\n\n* **Cultural agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of France**\n\n Allows for temporary employment under the cultural agreement between the Government of Canada and the Government of France, or under the terms of any educational, cultural, scientific, technical or artistic agreement made between France and a province of Canada within the framework of that agreement, provided that the applicants present to the officer a letter of acceptance by the appropriate governing body. Fee exempt.\n\n Supporting documentation: letter from the appropriate governing body.\n* **Cultural exchange between the Government of Canada and the People’s Republic of China**\n\n Under the terms of the cultural exchange program relating to the arts, archives, libraries, journalism, radio, television, film, literature, translation, architecture, social sciences and sports.
