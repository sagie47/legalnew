Temporary Resident Permits (TRPs): Removal orders and immigration warrants
==========================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

Issuing temporary resident permits to persons under a removal order
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Under the IRPA, a foreign national under a removal order may be issued a TRP. In some circumstances, issuing a TRP may be required when enforcement of the removal order is not possible.

**Consult with CBSA before issuing the TRP, and/or Case Management Branch, depending on the circumstances.**

Individuals named in an immigration warrant
-------------------------------------------

Under [section A55 (1) of IRPA](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-55.html?term=55), an officer may issue a warrant for the arrest and detention of a permanent resident or a foreign national who the officer has reasonable grounds to believe is inadmissible and is a danger to the public or is unlikely to appear for examination, for an admissibility hearing, for removal from Canada or at a proceeding that could lead to the making of a removal order by the Minister under [subsection A44(2) of IRPA](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/page-19.html#h-24).

After a full investigation, if the foreign national cannot be located, a Canada-wide warrant for their arrest is entered in the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) system by the officer conducting the investigation.

**When an individual named in a warrant submits an application, CIC must inform CBSA.**
