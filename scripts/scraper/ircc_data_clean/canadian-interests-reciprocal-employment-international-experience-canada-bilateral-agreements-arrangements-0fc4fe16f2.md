Bilateral agreements and arrangements: International Experience Canada (IEC) – [R204(d) – C21] – Reciprocity – International Mobility Program (IMP)
===================================================================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

In these instructions “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency.

There are 3 possible categories of participation through bilateral agreements and arrangements under the International Experience Canada (IEC) Program:

*   **Working Holiday** (travel and work): Participants are eligible to apply for an open work permit that will allow them to work for any employer at any location in Canada to subsidize their stay as they travel and discover the country.
*   **Young Professionals** (career development): Participants are eligible to apply for an [employer-specific work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html)that will help them gain professional work experience in Canada.
*   **International Co-op (Internship)** (internships for students only): Participants are eligible to apply for an [employer-specific work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html)that will help them gain experience in their field of study.

*   [Discontinuance requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/international-experience/canadian-interests-reciprocal-employment-international-experience-canada-bilateral-agreements-arrangements.html#discontinuance)
*   [Program requirements specific to each country or territory](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/international-experience/canadian-interests-reciprocal-employment-international-experience-canada-bilateral-agreements-arrangements.html#program)

Discontinuance requirements
---------------------------

Where there is a discontinuance requirement (meaning a specific length of discontinuous stay, specified in the agreement), the discontinuous stay will be calculated from the expiry of the first work permit.

For IEC, even though there are discontinuation clauses under the youth mobility agreements (YMAs), the clauses only apply between one IEC participation and the next IEC participation. If a foreign worker has finished their IEC participation and has applied for a work permit renewal in another work permit category, the discontinuation clause in the YMA doesn’t apply. For more information, consult [International Experience Canada (IEC) program participants changing work permit categories](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/authorization-work-without-work-permit-implied-status.html#Toc4).

For clients with dual citizenship, discontinuance only applies if the youth is participating consecutively under the same citizenship.

Applications for work permits in the IEC Program are always submitted “outside of Canada” and therefore do not meet the requirements for[maintained status](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/implied-status-extending-stay.html)for an extension of stay under[subsection 183(5) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-183.html). IEC work permit applications do not meet the requirements for work without a permit under[paragraph R186(u)](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html)either.

**Note 1:** French citizens who participated in the program prior to the 2015 quota year are eligible for 1 final participation in the category of their choosing. An applicant is considered to have participated prior to 2015 if their application(s) was submitted to any quota year prior to the launch of the 2015 quota year which took place on February 21, 2015. Those who have participated in IEC more than once before 2015 are no longer eligible.

**Note 2:** The Government of France established the Volontariat international en Entreprise (V.I.E) program to provide French youth with an opportunity to gain professional experience in an international environment. These youth are assigned to the international branches and subsidiaries of French-based companies. The primary objective of this program is the professional training of high-achieving French youth through international exposure. This allows them to boost their professional development and nurture potential future professional relationships between themselves and the host country.

Business France, the Government of France’s business export development and promotion agency, manages the VIE program. French youth participating in VIE do not receive either a salary or wages but rather a stipend or monthly allowance paid to them directly in France by Business France. This allowance helps VIE participants to cover the cost of living in their host country while also maintaining residential ties to France. VIE participants are to return to France upon completion of their assignment. Business France also guarantees that VIE participants do not become a financial burden for their host country by providing housing and covering any health-care costs.

**Note**: The Vives program was established by the Government of Spain through ICEX, a federal agency whose mission is the internationalization of the Spanish economy and Spanish companies. Modelled after the French Volontariat international en entreprise (VIE) program, ICEX Vives offers graduate internships to youth with companies legally incorporated in Spain, including subsidiaries, branches and representative offices in Canada. Its primary objective is to provide business development training to Spanish youth.

ICEX manages the Vives program through its offices in Spain. Spanish youth participating in the program do not receive a salary or wages, but they receive a grant paid to them directly by ICEX. The amount is determined according to the city and country of destination, ranging from €21,300 to €42,800 (approximately CAD 31,000 to CAD 62,000 as of December 2022). This allowance helps Vives participants cover round-trip travel expenses as well as living expenses in their host country. Vives participants are also provided with accident and travel insurance for the duration of their internships. Vives participants are to return to Spain upon completion of their placement.
