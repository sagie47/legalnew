Unique work situations – International Mobility Program and Temporary Foreign Worker Program
============================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

To determine whether a temporary resident requires a work permit or a Labour Market Impact Assessment(LMIA), the officer should first determine whether the activity the person seeks to engage in constitutes “work” as defined by the _Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations_. For a better understanding of the term “work”, refer to _[What is work](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/what-is-work.html)_.
