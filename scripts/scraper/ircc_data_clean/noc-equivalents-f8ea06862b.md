National Occupational Classification equivalents of Canada’s commitments in the Canada-European Union free-trade agreement
==========================================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement(CETA) between Canada and the European Union (EU) includes commitments for contractual service suppliers and independent professionals, which are listed in[Annex 10-E of the CETA](http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/text-texte/10-A.aspx?lang=eng#e), based on the United Nations Provisional Central Product Classification (CPC prov.) economic sectors.

Below is a comparative table guiding Canada’s implementation of CETA commitments through the National Occupational Classification (NOC) . Please note that Canada’s commitments in Annex 10-E are limited to

*   the NOC O and A levels if the application is received before November 16, 2022 (except for engineering and scientific technologists, which are NOC B)
*   Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER) categories 0 and 1, if the application is received November 16, 2022 or after (except for engineering and scientific technologists, which are TEER 2 and 3, and specialized livestock workers and farm machinery operators [NOC 84120], which are TEER 4)

In addition, commitments for contractual services suppliers and independent professionals vary by sector, as indicated in the chart below.

Please note that several sectors listed in Annex 10-E are not included in this list because Canada is “unbound” and did not take commitments for those sectors, meaning that both independent professionals and contractual service suppliers seeking entry related to these sectors would be subject to the domestic regime and the Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) process. These sectors include:

*   medical and dental services
*   veterinary services
*   midwifery services
*   services provided by nurses, physiotherapists and paramedical personnel
*   higher education services

Unless otherwise indicated, contractual service suppliers and independent professionals listed in the charts below are eligible for entry under the CETA without an LMIA. Please note that, if an applicant is not eligible under Canada’s CETA commitments, they can apply under Canada’s domestic regime.
