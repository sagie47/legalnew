About an eTA
------------

As per [subsection 11(1.01)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/page-6.html#h-9) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and [subsection 7.1(1)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/FullText.html#h-5) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), all visa-exempt foreign nationals travelling to or transiting through Canada by air must apply for an eTA through the electronic system before entering Canada.

This requirement does not apply to foreign nationals travelling to or transiting through Canada by land, sea or rail.

An eTA is valid for 5 years or until the applicant’s passport expires, whichever occurs sooner ([section R12.05](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-12.05.html#docCont)).

An eTA can be cancelled by a designated officer. Once cancelled, an eTA is no longer valid ([section R12.06](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-12.06.html#docCont)).

Who needs an eTA
----------------

An eTA is required for all visa-exempt foreign nationals, except United States(U.S.) citizens and [certain other small groups](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/eta.html#s04).

[Section R190](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-190.html) describes individuals who are exempt from the requirement to obtain a temporary resident visa. These individuals therefore require an eTA.

As of April 26, 2022, lawful permanent residents of the U.S. do not need an eTA to fly to or transit through a Canadian airport. In all methods of travel, they must present their passport and proof of their valid lawful permanent resident status in the U.S. (such as a valid green card or a valid I-551 [ADIT] stamp in their passport).

eTA expansion eligibility
-------------------------

[Subsections R7.01(1) and (2)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-7.01.html) expand the eligibility criteria of the eTA requirement to allow certain foreign nationals who meet specific conditions to apply for an eTA.

These foreign nationals may apply for an eTA only if they are travelling to Canada by air **and** if, at the time of application, either of the following applies:

*   they have held a Canadian temporary resident visa(TRV) in the past 10 years
*   they hold a valid U.S. nonimmigrant visa(NIV)

If such an individual does not meet the eligibility requirements listed above,they are **not** eligible to apply for an eTA. They must then be in possession of a valid [TRV](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors.html) to travel to or transit through Canada.

**Note:** If a foreign national holding an eTA on the basis of [eTA expansion eligibility](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-7.01.html) is travelling to or transiting through Canada by a means other than air, they must have a valid TRV.
