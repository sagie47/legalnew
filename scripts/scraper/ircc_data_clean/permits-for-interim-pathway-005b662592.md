Open work permits for applicants under the Interim Pathway for Caregivers
=========================================================================

All in-Canada visitor extension, study permit and work permit applications must be submitted electronically, with some exceptions. Consult the list of[programs that are exempt from the in-Canada mandatory electronic application requirement](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/place-application-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-study-permit-work-permit/exempt-electronic-applications.html).

Applicants under the Interim Pathway for Caregivers who have received a positive eligibility assessment of their application for permanent residence(APR) are eligible for an open work permit under public policy considerations, under paragraph 207(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations(IRPR), while they wait for their APR to be finalized.

Applicants’ family members **who are in Canada** are also eligible for an open work permit under paragraph R207(e).

Issuing an open work permit
