Business visitors – CUSMA [R186(a)] – Authorization to work without a work permit – International Mobility Program
==================================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

In these instructions “officers” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency.

The instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with

*   [Business visitors [R186(a)]: Authorization to work without a work permit– International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/business.html)
*   [Public list of Employers who have been non-compliant](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/public-list-employers-who-have-been-non-compliant.html)

Officers should initially assess American and Mexican citizens against the general [business visitor instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/business.html) for [R186(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) found in the [Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) and related Program Delivery Instructions (PDIs). In cases where their activities are not covered by the general provisions, officers should refer to the business visitor provisions provided in [Chapter 16 of the Canada– United States– Mexico Agreement (CUSMA)](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/cusma-aceum/text-texte/16.aspx?lang=eng) to determine eligibility under R186(a).

Eligibility
-----------

To be eligible as a business visitor under CUSMA, a foreign national must:

*   be a citizen of the U.S. or Mexico (this provision does not apply to permanent residents of either country);
*   be engaged in permissible business activities as described in [Annex 16-A: Section A](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/cusma-aceum/text-texte/16.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Section%20A%3A%C2%A0%20Business%20Visitors) of the CUSMA; 
*   be engaged in permissible activities that are international in scope; 
*   not have intent to enter the Canadian labour market: 
    *   the primary source of remuneration for the business activity remains outside Canada
    *   the principal place of business of the foreign national remains outside Canada

*   be compliant with existing immigration and admissibility requirements for temporary entry; and
*   request entry as a business visitor at the port of entry (POE).

Business visitors must apply at a POE in the same manner as persons covered by other paragraphs of [R186](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-186.html). An application cannot be made prior to arriving in Canada.

Border services officers at the Primary Inspection Line may make the determination that a foreign national meets the requirements for temporary entry as a business visitor, **except persons applying for entry under the after-sales service provision**, who should be referred to Immigration Secondary due to the complexity of the application and for reasons of client service and program consistency.

Permissible business activities
-------------------------------

The permissible business activities are generally of a commercial nature that reflect the components of a business cycle. Typical examples of business activities include, but are not limited to, consultation, negotiation, discussion, research, participation in educational, professional or business conventions or meetings and soliciting business.

The following are the permissible business activities under [Appendix 1, Section B](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/cusma-aceum/text-texte/16.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Section%20B%3A%C2%A0%20Business%20Activities) of the CUSMA:

Where an activity is not listed in[Appendix 1, Section B](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/cusma-aceum/text-texte/16.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Section%20B%3A%C2%A0%20Business%20Activities), officers should continue to assess the applicant against the general Business Visitor provisions found in the IRPR and the [related PDIs](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/business.html).

The term “commercial transaction” found in some provisions in Appendix 1, Section B of CUSMA may be described as any act within the confines of the law that is performed expressly to derive a profit. Commercial transactions refer to discussions and negotiations in respect to the sale, purchase, marketing, distribution, advertisement, procurement, transmission, transportation or packaging of goods or services.

### Research and design

*   Technical, scientific and statistical researchers conducting independent research or research for an [enterprise](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#e1) located in the U.S. or Mexico.

### Growth, manufacture, and production

*   Purchasing and production management personnel conducting [commercial transactions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#c2) for an enterprise located in the U.S. or Mexico.
*   The owner of a harvester (a machine used for gathering agricultural crops, such as grains, fruits or vegetables) who is supervising a harvesting crew is authorized to enter Canada to operate the machine under this provision. The crew do not qualify under this provision and must be authorized to work in Canada. 

### Marketing

*   Market researchers and analysts conducting independent research or analysis for an enterprise located in the U.S. or Mexico.
*   Trade fair and promotional personnel attending a trade convention to only promote their product may be granted entry under this provision. For [Sales](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/cusma/business-visitors.html#s2-4) different provisions apply.
*   Organizers of trade fairs whose exhibitors are wholly of U.S. or Mexican origin may be granted entry under this provision.

### Sales

*   Sales representatives and agents taking orders or negotiating contracts for goods or services for an enterprise located in the U.S. or Mexico but not delivering goods or supplying services cannot sell Canadian-made goods or services provided by a Canadian enterprise. 
*   Buyers purchasing for an enterprise located in the U.S. or Mexico may be granted entry.

### General service

*   Professionals engaging in a business activity at a professional level in a profession set out in [Appendix 2](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/cusma-aceum/text-texte/16.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=of%20another%20Party.-,APPENDIX%202,-PROFESSIONALS) of CUSMA 
    *   In order to determine whether the professional meets the conditions of R186(a) an officer should consider how the professional is being renumerated. An individual who is to be paid in Canada would be considered to be joining the labour market and could not be authorized to enter Canada as a business visitor, whereas, professionals whose primary source of remuneration for the business activity remains outside Canada may qualify.

### Commercial transactions

*   Management and supervisory personnel engaging in a [commercial transaction](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#c2) for an enterprise.
*   Financial services personnel (insurers, bankers or investment brokers) engaging in commercial transactions for an enterprise located in the U.S. or Mexico.

### Public relations and advertising

*   Public relations and advertising personnel consulting with [business associates](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#b1) (colleagues or clients), or attending or participating in conventions.

### Distribution

This provision includes American or Mexican citizens operating a method of transportation that is:

*   moving goods or passengers to Canada from the U.S. or Mexico;
*   loading and transporting goods or passengers from Canada to the U.S. or Mexico, with no unloading of those same goods or passengers in Canada.

Included in this provision are citizens of the U.S. or Mexico, who are necessary for the operation of the transportation conveyance (e.g. a transport truck) used to transport goods or passengers during the trip. This includes the driver, and any relief drivers, and other U.S. or Mexican citizens on the vehicle providing services that support the moving operation of the vehicle or passengers.

The following groups can be authorized to enter under this provision:

*   **Pilot vehicle drivers**
    *   Persons operating [highway pilot vehicles](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#h1) can be authorized to enter Canada as a member of a crew, pursuant to[R186(s)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html),provided the foreign pilot-vehicle driver is _accompanying_ a foreign-owned and foreign-registered vehicle. 
    *   Ownership of the pilot vehicle is not relevant. This is consistent with the U.S. interpretation of pilot-vehicle drivers entering the U.S. from Canada.

*   **Taxi-drivers and passenger-van operators**
    *   Entry to pick-up passengers for delivery to the U.S. pursuant to an oral or written contract for services is permitted, provided that all passengers picked up are disembarked only in the U.S.

*   **Transport truck drivers**
    *   Transport truck drivers involved in international hauling of goods should not become involved in the loading or unloading of cargo, however there are instances where it is acceptable (e.g., in non-warehouse situations and for cargo such as furniture, chemicals, livestock and building materials). Thus, in special circumstances, particularly involving load safety, the provision also allows the driver, including a relay driver, and the other persons described as necessary for the operation of the transport truck, to participate in the loading and unloading of goods.

*   [**Relay drivers**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#r2)
    *   Operators who drive a portion or portions of a route are also covered by this provision. A relay truck or bus driver need not enter Canada on the truck or bus. A relay driver may enter Canada within a reasonable time before or after the truck or bus enters.

*   **Customs brokers**
    *   Customs brokers providing consulting services regarding the facilitation of the import or export of goods may enter Canada.
    *   With respect to temporary entry into the U.S., this includes Canadian customs brokers performing brokerage duties relating to the export of goods from the U.S. to or through Canada.

The following groups are **not**authorized to enter under the Distribution provision

*   **Loaders or loading personnel**
    *   This provision does not apply to a person whose only or main job duty is to load or unload the vehicle. Thus, the “crew” of a moving van, other than a driver, is not covered. Nor is a helper on a delivery truck covered by the provision (for instance, a helper on a truck delivering large appliances from a store in an American border town to a Canadian customer).

*   **Cabotage**
    *   An American or Mexican truck driver may load goods in the U.S. or Mexico, then deliver partial loads at several locations in Canada. An American or Mexican driver may also pick-up goods in Canada at one or more locations and take them to the U.S. or Mexico. The American or Mexican driver may combine any or all of these pick-ups and deliveries in one trip as long as the goods picked up in Canada have a final destination in the U.S. or Mexico and are not delivered to another Canadian location. **Cabotage** involving pick-up and delivery of the same goods between one location in Canada and another is **not allowed**.

### Tourism

Tourism personnel (tour and travel agents, tour guides or tour operators) attending or participating in conventions or conducting a tour that has begun in the territory of another Party.

**Note:** Tourism personnel and tour participants must congregate at a point in the U.S. or Mexico and travel as a group when entering Canada. Tourism personnel wishing to use Canada as a base and seeking entry to conduct tours from within Canada require a work permit.

### Tour bus operation

This provision allows [tour bus operators](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#t1) to enter Canada for a tour of one or several Canadian locations as long as the trip originates or terminates in the U.S. or Mexico.

*   Permitted scenarios under CUSMA include 
    *   A tour bus with a group of passengers on a bus tour that has begun in, and will return to the U.S. or Mexico.
    *   A tour bus going to pickup a group of passengers for a tour that will predominantly take place and end in the U.S. or Mexico.
    *   A tour bus with a group of passengers on a bus tour to be unloaded in Canada, and returning to the U.S. or Mexico with no passengers, or loading with a new group for transportation to the U.S. or Mexico.
    *   [Relay drivers](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#r2) are also covered by this provision. A relay tour bus driver need not enter Canada on the tour bus. A relay driver may enter Canada within a reasonable time before or after the tour bus enters.

*   Prohibited scenarios under CUSMA include 
    *   Tours that originate in Canada and take place predominantly in Canada, with a minimum time spent in the U.S. or Mexico. These do not qualify under CUSMA even if the bus crosses the international boundary during the course of the tour. Operators of such a tour would not be admissible as “business visitors.”
    *   Foreign [tour bus operators](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#t1) and [transportation operators](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#t2) are still prohibited from conducting “point-to-point” service (for example, “cabotage ”) within Canada – e.g. they cannot pick up passengers in Canada when the final destination of those passengers is another location in Canada. For instance, while an American tour bus operator is allowed to pick up from and return passengers to Canada, specifically for a tour which will take place predominantly in the U.S., the tour bus operator cannot pick up and drop off additional passengers in Canada on his way to the U.S. or when returning from the U.S. following the tour.

If a tour originates in Canada (for example, a bus enters Canada to pick up passengers), the predominant portion of the tour must then take place in the U.S. or Mexico in order to preserve the international nature of the tour. Passengers may be returned to Canada following the tour which has taken place predominantly in the U.S. or Mexico.

### Translation

Translators or interpreters performing services as employees of an enterprise located in the U.S. or Mexico.

### After-sales service

After-sales service includes the installation, repair, or servicing of commercial, industrial equipment, machinery, or computer software.

Installation includes setting-up and testing of the commercial, industrial equipment, machinery, or computer software. It does **not** include operating the equipment or machinery, or computer software for production.

#### Specific eligibility requirements for after-sales service

The following requirements apply to business visitors seeking entry under the after-sales service provisions of CUSMA:

*   citizen of the U.S. or Mexico, who is employed by an enterprise established in the U.S. or Mexico;
*   purpose of entry is to install, repair, service, or supervise these functions, or train workers to perform services;
*   work is pursuant to original sales contract and any warranty or service agreement incidental (connected) to the sale of equipment or machinery (including computer software);
*   equipment or machinery (including computer software) is commercial or industrial (not for household or personal use);
*   equipment or machinery or computer software was manufactured and [purchased](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#p2) outside Canada;
*   work is carried out during the validity of any warranty or service agreement or any extensions of same;
*   work requires specialized knowledge (which excludes hands-on building and construction work); and
*   compliance with existing immigration requirements for temporary entry.

**Note:** persons granted entry to train or to supervise training may also train or supervise workers who are doing the hands-on building and construction work. This may require demonstrating certain procedures. The demonstration must not result in the completion of an [installation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#i1) or servicing task, or of part of such task, or in the productive operation of the equipment or machinery.

The CUSMA **does not**relieve after-sales service personnel, or any other business person, from the obligation to comply with municipal, regional, provincial/territorial, or other federal requirements where these apply.

#### Work that does not meet the eligibility requirements of after-sales service

Persons whose activities or services in Canada would constitute hands-on building and construction work may **not** enter under [R186(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) and CUSMA as after-sales service.

Generally the entry of foreign tradespersons in the building and construction industry is subject to an assessment of the availability of domestic labour (an LMIA). As part of the LMIA process, Service Canada will consult with organized labour prior to making a determination.

For personnel performing the installation or servicing, entry should not be granted when performing hands-on building and construction work. The performance of these activities are not permitted, regardless of wording in sales, warranty or service agreements supporting they be completed.

**Building and construction work:** includes installing, maintaining, and repairing utility services, any part of the fabric of any building or structure, or machinery, equipment, or structures within a building.

Building and construction work includes activities normally performed by (but not limited to):

*   labourers;
*   millwrights;
*   heat and frost insulators;
*   bricklayers;
*   carpenters and joiners;
*   electrical workers;
*   operating engineers (includes heavy equipment operators);
*   elevator constructors;
*   sheet metal workers;
*   teamsters;
*   boilermakers;
*   residential, commercial, or industrial painters (including the application of all service coatings no matter how applied);
*   bridge, structural, and ornamental ironworkers;
*   plumbers and pipefitters;
*   roofers; and
*   plasterers and cement masons.

Building and construction work includes work involving:

*   assembly lines;
*   conveyor belts and systems;
*   overhead cranes;
*   heating, cooling, and ventilation or exhaust systems;
*   elevators and escalators;
*   boilers and turbines; and
*   dismantling or demolition of commercial or industrial equipment or machinery, whether on-site or in-plant.

Documentary evidence
--------------------

A business visitor under CUSMA must provide the following documentation:

*   proof of American or Mexican citizenship;
*   documentation to support the purpose for entry (must be a business activity listed in [Appendix 1, Section B](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/cusma-aceum/text-texte/16.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Section%20B%3A%C2%A0%20Business%20Activities) of CUSMA); and
*   evidence that the business activity is international in scope and that the they are not attempting to enter the Canadian labour market. 
    *   the primary source of remuneration is outside Canada, and
    *   the person’s place of business remains outside Canada and the profits of the business are accumulated primarily outside Canada.

Oral declaration as to the principal place of business and the actual place of accrual of profits can be used as documentary evidence. If further proof is requested, a letter from the employer or the representing organization is sufficient. Prior approval procedures, labour certification tests, or other similar procedures cannot be required. Every effort should be made to avoid the requirement of a visa.

In general, an individual who is to be paid in Canada would be considered to be joining the labour market and could not be authorized to enter Canada as a business visitor. The payment of expenses incidental to the trip is allowed, as is an honorarium.

### Documentary evidence for after-sales service

Business visitors applying under the after-sales service provision of CUSMA should be referred for a secondary examination when seeking entry, as per [Appendix 1, Section B](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/cusma-aceum/text-texte/16.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Section%20B%3A%C2%A0%20Business%20Activities) of the agreement.

The following documentation is required:

*   proof of American or Mexican citizenship; and
*   copies of the original sales agreement, and warranty or service agreement, including extensions, which clearly support the purpose of entry.

The warranty or service contract must be incidental to, or connected to the sale of commercial or industrial equipment or machinery, including computer software.

The warranty or service agreement does not need to have the same date as the sales agreement. Particularly with third party service as it may take a number of months after the sale before the company installing or servicing the machinery is identified and sub-contracted.

The initial warranty or service agreement may be extended provided that the sales agreement, or initial warranty or service agreement contained a provision allowing for the extension. The after- sales service, therefore, continues to be contracted as part of the sale of the equipment or machinery, or computer software.

### Third party service

If [third party service](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#t3) occurs, there must be clear wording in the sales agreement that specifies a third party will perform the installation, warranty, or service work. Unless such wording exists, there is no evidence that the third party service is incidental to the sale. However, the firm need not be named in the agreement, as it may take some time for the firm to be identified. When a third party is not named in the sales agreement, business visitors may be expected to provide a letter from the seller of the equipment that identifies them as the third party referenced in the original sales agreement.

When a seller located in the U.S. or Mexico contracts the after-sales servicing to a third party, it must be established in the U.S. or Mexico.

### Lack of Documentation

Every effort should be made to allow documentation to be provided (e.g., by fax, email or verbal explanation) from the company in Canada or the business visitor’s employer in the U.S. or Mexico.

The requirement of documentation has been imposed in order to clearly establish that the proposed activity is incidental or connected to the sale of the equipment or machinery or computer software.

A verbal statement that the business of the applicant is being carried on outside Canada can be acceptable. Alternative indications (business cards, business papers, advertising pamphlets, etc.) may be helpful.

Final decision
--------------

### Visitor record

A business visitor’s stay in Canada will usually be short-term (6 months or less).

It is recommended that border services officers consider issuing a [visitor record](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/visitor-record.html) to a business visitor engaged in ‘after-sales service’ work for a period of longer than 6 months and indicate in the “Remarks” section why a longer period of time is being granted.

These visits may take place over a period of weeks or months. In these circumstances, border services officers should consider issuing a visitor record to reduce potential referrals on future entries.

Applications for extension of status should be determined based on whether the foreign national remains eligible.
