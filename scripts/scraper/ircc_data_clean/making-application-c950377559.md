How applicants can apply
------------------------

Foreign nationals require a [temporary resident visa(TRV)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/what-visa.html) or an [electronic travel authorization(eTA)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/eta.html) to enter Canada, unless exempt from eTA requirements. For overseas applications, if the application for a study permit is approved, a TRV or an eTA is issued automatically. There is no separate fee or application for a TRV or an eTA [subsections [R296(2)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-296.html) and [R294.1(2)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-294.1.html)] with a study permit application.

As per [ministerial instructions 62 (MI62)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions/other-goals/mi62.html), all applications for a study permit for foreign nationals who are outside Canada at the time of application must be submitted using electronic means—**meaning they must apply online**. The following are the exceptions to the requirement to apply online for study permits:

*   foreign nationals who are outside Canada and who are unable to apply online, including for reasons of a disability, and require accommodation for the use of electronic means
*   foreign nationals in possession of an identity or travel document described in paragraph [R52(1)(c)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-52.html) issued by a country, that does not prohibit travel to Canada, that the foreign national may use to enter the country of issue and that is of the type issued by that country to non-national residents, refugees or stateless persons who are unable to obtain a passport or other travel document from their country of citizenship or nationality or who have no country of citizenship or nationality.

As per section [R9.2](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-9.2.html), all in-Canada visitor extension, study permit and work permit applications **must be submitted online**, with some exceptions, indicated in sections [R9.4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-9.4.html) and [R9.5](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-9.5.html). In addition, see the list of specific [programs that are exempt from the in-Canada mandatory electronic application requirement](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/place-application-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-study-permit-work-permit/exempt-electronic-applications.html).

All applications, whether from in Canada or overseas, must be made through the [**IRCC secure account portal**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account.html) or the [**Authorized Paid Representatives Portal**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/partners-service-providers/authorized-paid-representatives-portal.html). If an exception to applying online applies, other means can be obtained on the IRCC website.

### Processing applications from overseas

For **TRV-required foreign nationals**, including those eligible to apply for an eTA through [eTA expansion](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-7.01.html), the TRV should be issued for multiple entries. It should be valid for the same period as the study permit or passport, whichever expires first, unless otherwise specified.

For **eTA-required foreign nationals**, the eTA is valid for 5 years from the date of issuance or until the foreign national’s passport expires, whichever occurs first, regardless of whether or not this date is after the expiry date of the study permit.

**Foreign nationals who are eligible for eTA expansion** receive a TRV upon the issuance of their initial study permit. If these clients are issued a renewed study permit, they are automatically issued an eTA. However, these foreign nationals still require a TRV to travel by any mode of transportation other than air.

As of April 26, 2022, **lawful permanent residents of the United States (US)** do not need an eTA to fly to or transit through a Canadian airport. In all methods of travel, they must present their passport and proof of their valid lawful permanent resident status in the US (such as a valid green card or a valid I-551 [ADIT] stamp in their passport).

**Note:** While a study permit is not required for short-term courses of less than 6 months in duration, an officer must accept and process an application for a study permit, even when the duration of the course or program of study is 6 months or less [subsection [R188(2)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-188.html)].

#### Prerequisite courses

When assessing bona fides and available funds, IRCC offices abroad should consider the applicant’s main program of study before issuing a study permit for a prerequisite course or program.

Some students must participate in a prerequisite English as a second language(ESL) or French as a second language(FSL) program before the start of the academic, professional or vocational program. Students in this situation may be issued a study permit for the duration of the ESL or FSL program plus 90 days. The permit includes the condition that the holder is **not** permitted to engage in off-campus employment in Canada.

**Note**: As of November 08, 2024, students changing DLIs at the post-secondary level need to apply for a new study permit. Refer to [Study permits: Designated learning institutions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/designated-learning-institutions.html) and [Study permits: Assessing study permit conditions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/assessing-conditions.html) for more information.

### Issuing an eTA

Once the study permit has been approved, if the foreign national requires an eTA, per [section 12.04](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-12.04.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations(IRPR), an eTA control document should be created. If this needs to be done manually, officers should refer to the Global Case Management System(GCMS) instructions to find out how to generate an eTA control document. They must select “eTA/AVE.”

Per [section R12.05](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-12.05.html), the eTA validity must be set for 5 years or until the applicant’s passport expires, whichever occurs first, regardless of whether or not this date is after the expiry date of the study permit.

**Note:** If an eTA is automatically created in error in the GCMS, it should be cancelled before the approved study permit is printed.

#### Who should not be issued an eTA

An eTA should **not** be issued with a study permit extension if the foreign national

*   has an unenforceable removal order
*   has been issued a permit stating that “this document does not confer temporary resident status”
*   has overstayed their authorized period of stay
*   is a temporary resident permit(TRP) holder and is inadmissible to Canada
*   is a lawful permanent resident of the United States

In all of the above cases, officers must cancel all valid eTAs, including those issued through the expansion of eTA.

### Who can apply at a POE

The foreign nationals who may apply for a study permit when entering Canada (section [R214](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-214.html)) are any

*   national or permanent residents of the United States(US)
*   people who have lawfully been admitted to the US for permanent residence
*   residents of Greenland or St. Pierre and Miquelon

**Note:** As of April 26, 2022, lawful permanent residents of the US do not need an eTA to fly to or transit through a Canadian airport. In all methods of travel, they must present their passport and proof of their valid lawful permanent resident status in the US (such as a valid green card or a valid I-551 [ADIT] stamp in their passport). 

 To apply for a study permit at an air POE, a lawful permanent resident of the US who is travelling to Canada must apply for and obtain an eTA before boarding their flight to Canada.

### Who can apply from within Canada

The foreign nationals who may apply for a study permit after entering Canada (section [R215](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-215.html)), including to change or vary their existing conditions, are the following:

*   Foreign nationals in Canada without a study permit who 
    *   are studying at the preschool, primary or secondary level [subparagraph R215(1)(f)(i)]
    *   are a visiting or exchange student studying at a [designated learning institution(DLI)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/designated-learning-institutions.html)[subparagraph R215(1)(f)(ii)]
    *   have completed a course or program of study that is a prerequisite for their enrolment at a DLI [subparagraph R215(1)(f)(iii)]

*   foreign nationals and their family members who hold a valid study or work permit [paragraphs R215(1)(a) and (c), section R215.1]]
*   foreign nationals who have obtained authorization to engage in studies in Canada without a study permit, pursuant to[subsection 30(2)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-30.html)of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act(IRPA) or paragraph[R188(1)(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-188.html), and whose application is made within the period starting 90 days before and ending 90 days after the expiry of the authorization [paragraph R215(1)(b)]
*   foreign nationals and their family members who are subject to an unenforceable removal order, including refugee protection claimants [paragraph R215(1)(d)]
*   foreign nationals and their family members who hold a temporary resident permit(TRP), pursuant to subsection[A24(1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-24.html), that is valid for at least 6 months 
*   protected persons within the meaning of[subsection A95(2)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-95.html) and their family members
*   permanent residence applicants and their family members who are determined eligible for permanent resident status as one of the following, as per section R207: 
    *   spouse or common-law partner in Canada class
    *   people who have been granted an exemption: 
        *   on humanitarian and compassionate grounds pursuant to[subsections A25(1) or A25.1(1)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-25.html)
        *   on public policy grounds pursuant to subsection A25.2(1)

*   family members of participants in sports activities or events in Canada, either as individual participants or as members of a foreign-based team or Canadian amateur team [paragraph R215(2)(g)]
*   family members of 
    *   designated members of the armed forces [paragraph R215(2)(e)]
    *   officers of a foreign government [paragraph R215(2)(f)]
    *   employees of a foreign news company [paragraph R215(2)(h)]
    *   people responsible for assisting a congregation [paragraph R215(2)(i)]

In Canada situations
--------------------

### Applications for a study permit approved abroad

Foreign nationals whose application for a study permit has been approved abroad, but who did not obtain their study permit at a POE on their initial arrival (for example, they failed to present a letter of introduction), should contact the Client Support Centre via the [IRCC web form](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/contact-ircc/web-form.html) to learn how to obtain their study permit.

**Note:** The foreign national may not engage in studies until a study permit is issued.

### Study permit renewals

An application for a study permit renewal does not constitute an application for a TRV. Therefore, visa-required foreign nationals must apply separately for a TRV and pay the corresponding fee.

Per subsection [R12.04(5)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-12.04.html), an application for a renewal of a study permit for a visa exempt foreign national is considered to constitute an application for an eTA. Therefore, an eTA should be issued upon approval of the study permit (that is, SP-EXT in the GCMS). Clients eligible for an eTA through eTA expansion are also issued an eTA upon the issuance of a study permit renewal.

**Note:** If an eTA is issued with a renewed study permit for an eTA expansion client, and if the client holds a valid TRV, the officer should not cancel the existing TRV. The client can continue to use the TRV to travel to Canada by air, land or sea until it expires.

### Visitors in Canada

Foreign nationals who are in-Canada visitors are **not** eligible to apply for a study permit from within Canada unless they are exempt under [section R215](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-215.html). They must submit their application package online or to a Visa Application Centre (VAC). If their application is approved, they must obtain their study permit at a POE by presenting the Letter of Introduction (LOI) they received from IRCC at a POE. To do this, the client would need to leave and return to Canada, which can be done by entering a country by private vehicle or commercial carrier (for example, plane, boat, train or bus) and coming back to Canada. There is no guarantee that the client would be allowed to re-enter Canada, since CBSA will assess their admissibility when they seek re-entry.

Foreign nationals who are already in Canada and are studying at the preschool, primary or secondary level [subparagraph R215(1)(f)(i)], or who are a visiting or exchange student at a [DLI](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/designated-learning-institutions.html) [subparagraph R215(1)(f)(ii)], may apply for a study permit from within Canada. The applicant must provide a letter of acceptance from the DLI at which they are enrolled or will be enrolled.

**Visiting students** are students who have been admitted to a post-secondary institution for a period of study but who are not admitted into a degree or diploma program. They are students at a foreign institution (often referred to as the student’s home institution) who attend a Canadian institution (referred to as the student’s host institution) for a period of time, with the intent of transferring the credits earned at the host institution back to their home institution. Visiting students pay fees to the host institution.

**Exchange students** are students who have been admitted to an institution as visiting students. However, they are not subject to any tuition fees from their host institution, as these fees are covered by an exchange agreement between the host and home institutions.

*   A study permit is not required if their length of stay is **less than 6 months** [R188(1)(c)]. 
    *   However, these students they may still apply for a study permit. 

*   A study permit is required if their length of stay is **6 months or longer** in duration.

Students participating in exchange programs are only eligible to work off campus if they hold a study permit. The processing officer must include the appropriate work authorization conditions when issuing a study permit to exchange students.

While a study permit is not required for short-term courses, an officer must accept and process an application for a study permit, even when the duration of the course or program of study is 6 months or less [subsection [R188(2)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-188.html)].

**Reminder**: As of November 08, 2024, students changing DLIs at the post-secondary level need to apply for a new study permit. For more information on changing DLIs, see [Study permits: Designated learning institutions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/designated-learning-institutions.html) and [Study permits: Assessing study permit conditions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/assessing-conditions.html).

### Prerequisite course or program of study before the main program of study

Visitors in Canada who have completed a course or program of study that was previously identified as a prerequisite for their admission into a program of study at a [DLI](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/designated-learning-institutions.html) may also apply for a study permit from within Canada [subparagraph R215(1)(f)(iii)] if they provide all of the following:

*   a [letter of acceptance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/letters-acceptance.html) received from a DLI before or after the completion of the prerequisite course that confirms the course is a prerequisite for admission to the main program
*   proof of successful completion of the prerequisite course, such as a letter from the destination DLI explicitly confirming that the student has completed the prerequisite course or program of study or a notification of completion from the institution at which the prerequisite course was taken
*   a [provincial or territorial attestation letter (PAL/TAL)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/attestation-letters.html)

Foreign nationals are **not** eligible to apply for a study permit from within Canada [subparagraph R215(1)(f)(iii)] if they are either of the following:

*   unable to provide a [letter of acceptance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/letters-acceptance.html) issued by a DLI either before or after the prerequisite course that proves the course is a prerequisite for entry to the main program
*   admitted to a program with a language requirement, but a specific language training course or program is not specified in the letter of acceptance as a prerequisite for entry to the main program (for example, wording such as “must provide proof of English proficiency” does not indicate the need for a prerequisite)

Students taking a prerequisite course or program of study may [work on campus](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/working-on-campus.html) provided they meet all other eligibility requirements. They are not eligible to work off campus while completing their prerequisite. However, they are able to work off campus once they have completed their prerequisite and have received their new study permit to commence their main program.

Refer to [Study permits: Designated learning institutions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/designated-learning-institutions.html) for more information on the following scenarios:

*   Changing designated learning institutions
*   Transition between levels of study
*   Dual-credit programs at the secondary level.

Determining applicants’ status
------------------------------

The instructions below are to help determine whether or not the applicant has temporary resident status at the time of application. This can be a factor when applying for a study permit extension.

### Status as of the date of the application

For electronic applications, the application is deemed to have been received at the time and date indicated by the electronic means as per subsection [R9.3(1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-9.3.html). The department uses [Coordinated Universal Time](https://time.is/UTC) (UTC) around the world to ensure that time is equal for all. Therefore, receipt dates and times do not depend on time zones; all applications must be submitted before midnight UTC on the date the applicant’s status expires.

For further information, see [Date and time of receipt of application](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/implied-status-extending-stay.html#sec1) for program instruction regarding receipt of an application.

In cases where an exception to applying online applies, the date the application is physically received at the Case Processing Centre is considered to be the effective date of the application. If the effective date is after the expiry date of the applicant’s status, the officer will backdate the received date by 7 days to account for any mail delivery delays.

### Out of status

If the applicant’s status has expired upon receipt of the application, the applicant is to be considered out of status. Officers should refer to [section A47](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-47.html) to identify cases where a foreign national loses temporary resident status.
