Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA) [204(a) – F70, F71, F72, F73, F74] – Agreements or arrangements – International Mobility Program
============================================================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

The [Canada-Ukraine Free Trade Agreement (CUFTA)](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ukraine/index.aspx?lang=eng) is an international agreement between Canada and Ukraine, and as such any work permit applications are assessed under paragraph 204(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR). This regulatory section falls under the International Mobility Program.

Updates to the CUFTA related to immigration came into force on July 1, 2024.

[Chapter 21: Temporary Entry for Business Persons](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ukraine/text-texte/2023/21.aspx?lang=eng) of the CUFTA facilitates temporary entry to Canada for certain categories of business persons who hold citizenship or are permanent residents in Ukraine.

As detailed below, administrative codes have been created to capture data about business persons visiting through CUFTA more effectively.

Categories for temporary entry
------------------------------

The CUFTA facilitates temporary entry for the following categories of business persons:

*   [Business visitors](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/cufta/business-visitors.html) – Work permit exempt under paragraph R186(a)
*   [Investors – Administrative code F70](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/cufta/investors.html)
*   [Intra – corporate transferees – Administrative codes F71, F74](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/cufta/transferees.html)

Place of application
--------------------

Ukrainian citizens require a [temporary resident visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html#visaRequired) to travel to Canada, and must submit an application to an IRCC office from outside Canada. Citizens of [countries that are exempt from the requirement for a temporary resident visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/entry-requirements-country.html#visaRequired) may apply for a work permit at the port of entry. Applications may be submitted from within Canada if they meet the conditions set out in [section 199](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-199.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.

Business visitors are work permit exempt but the business reason should be selected in the “purpose of entry” field on the application for their temporary resident visa.

Spousal provisions – Administrative code F73
--------------------------------------------

Work authorization for accompanying spouses is also facilitated, with the exception of business visitors. For spouses, the length of stay, including extensions, should be the same as the principal applicant.

Specific details on spousal eligibility, including citizenship requirements, are in the [category pages](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/cufta.html#categories-temporary-entry).

Extending work permits issued under the CUFTA
---------------------------------------------

The CUFTA allows for the extension of work permits originally issued in accordance with the CUFTA, with the exception of investors. Work permits may be extended at the discretion of the officer assessing the application, provided that the necessary documentary evidence has been submitted by the applicant to support the request.

To extend a CUFTA work permit, the employer must submit a new International Mobility Program (IMP) offer of employment and the applicant must comply with regular work permit extension requirements.

When reviewing the duration requested by the employer, officers should examine the application and the IMP offer of employment to ensure that the requirements and purpose of entry under the CUFTA are still being met. Extension applications under [section R201](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-201.html) should be made online. Applications submitted at a port of entry or at an IRCC office outside of Canada are considered to be new work permit applications under [section R200](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html).

Examples of acceptable documentation to support an extension include the following:

*   a service contract extension justification from the offering enterprise
*   updated business plans
*   an offer for a new contract
*   feasibility studies and marketing plans

### Determining eligibility for an extension

To determine eligibility, officers should consider the following factors:

*   the **intentions** of the applicant 
    *   What is the applicant doing in Canada?
    *   How long has the applicant been here?
    *   How long is the request for?

*   the **reason given** by the applicant for applying for the extension 
    *   Are the plans well thought out or merely frivolous?
    *   Has the applicant previously received an extension?

*   the applicant’s **situation in their home country**
    *   What family, employment or other responsibilities and obligations has the person left behind?
    *   How have these responsibilities been discharged?
    *   Is a prolonged stay in Canada reasonable and feasible?

*   the **initial intent** of the application 
    *   What was the original purpose of the business visit to Canada?
    *   Has the original purpose of the business visit been fulfilled?
    *   If the original purpose of the business visit has not been fulfilled, was sufficient time originally granted to fulfill the purpose?

*   the **necessary licence or documentation** to practise the applicant’s occupation in Canada in instances where an occupation is regulated at a provincial or territorial level 
    *   For example, in most provinces and territories, electrician and plumber are regulated occupations and require documentation to be practised.
