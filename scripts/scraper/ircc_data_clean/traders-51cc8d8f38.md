Eligibility
-----------

To be eligible as a trader under the CCOFTA, the following must apply:

*   be a citizen, national or permanent resident of Colombia;
*   the employing enterprise has Colombian [nationality](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/canada-colombia/traders.html#nationality);
*   activities involve [substantial trade](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/canada-colombia/traders.html#substantial-trade) in goods or services;
*   trade is principally between Canada and Colombia;
*   position is [supervisory or executive capacity](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/canada-colombia/traders.html#supervisory-executive), or involves [essential skills](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/canada-colombia/traders.html#essential-skills);
*   compliance with existing immigration requirements for temporary entry.

**Note:** A foreign national can be granted authority to work as a trader or investor, but not both.

The foreign national may be trading on their own behalf or as an agent of a person or an organization engaged in trade principally between Canada and Colombia.

Documentary evidence
--------------------

A foreign national must provide sufficient documentary evidence to satisfy an officer that they are eligible for entry.

The following documents and evidence are required:

*   proof of Colombian citizenship, nationality or permanent residency
*   documentation that shows the [nationality of the enterprise](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/canada-colombia/traders.html#nationality) established in Canada 
    *   Colombian nationality means that the individual or corporate persons who own at least 50 percent interest (directly or by stock) in the entity established in Canada must hold Colombian citizenship.
    *   joint ventures and partnerships are limited to two parties.

*   proof that the business person meets the trade requirements: 
    *   the person’s predominant activity in Canada must be international trade (See [substantial trade](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/canada-colombia/traders.html#substantial-trade));
    *   over 50 percent of the total volume of international [trade](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#t5) conducted by the entity must be between Canada and Colombia;
    *   trade between Colombia and Canada must already be in existence as evidenced by completed sales or binding contracts that call for the immediate exchange of goods or services.

*   proof that the applicant’s job duties in Canada will be employed in a capacity that is [supervisory or executive](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#s6) or involves [essential skills](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#e2);
*   an offer of employment submitted through the Employer Portal or through [alternate means](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/place-application-visa-electronic-travel-authorization-study-permit-work-permit/exempt-electronic-applications.html#exceptions) if authorized: 
    *   The offer of employment provides confirmation of the pre-arranged employment;
    *   the proposed employer in Canada;
    *   the profession for which entry is sought; and
    *   details of the position: title, duties, duration of employment, arrangements as to payment.

Place of application
--------------------

Foreign nationals who are exempt from the requirement for a temporary resident visa may apply for a work permit at the port of entry, as well as foreign nationals who otherwise meet the requirements of [R198](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-198.html). However, due to the complexity of the application and for reasons of client service, program consistency and reciprocity, the initial application for a work permit as a trader should be submitted outside of Canada.

For more information, see: [Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) and International Mobility Program (IMP): Persons who may apply at a port of entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/persons-who-may-apply-port-entry.html).

Foreign nationals may apply for a work permit from within Canada if they meet the requirements of section [R199](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-199.html).

**Extension applications**: Upon receiving a request for extension, officers should compare the information provided in the initial or previous work permit application with that presented in support of the extension request.

An applicant’s expression of a definite intention to return to Colombia their country of origin when trader status terminates will normally be accepted as sufficient evidence of temporary intent unless there are indications to the contrary.

Authorized work as a trader would end upon the applicant taking another job, engaging in an activity which is not consistent with this status, closing down the business, etc.

Application assessment
----------------------

### Review of the offer of employment

When assessing if the work permit application meets the requirements of the CCOFTA, officers should review the offer of employment that appears under the Employment Details tab in the Global Case Management System (GCMS) for information provided by the employer (who could be the applicant) or the matching fields on the IMM 5802 form (if the employer was authorized to use it).

| Field | Considerations |
| --- | --- |
| LMIA Exemption | **F10 –** CCOFTA – R204(a) – Traders |
| Requirements Exemptions Met | Has the employer indicated how the position in Canada meets the eligibility requirements for the CCOFTA? For example, what is the trade being made or proposed and what is the position that the foreign national will hold? |
| Employer | Does the enterprise employing the foreign national have Colombian citizenship, nationality or permanent residency? |
| NOC and Job Title | Do the National Occupational Classification (NOC) code and job title align with their duties as the trader? |
| Duration | The maximum duration for initial work permits under the trader category is 1 year. Is the employer requesting a longer period of time than what is allowed under the CCOFTA? If yes, this may be an indicator that the foreign national may not be entering for a temporary purpose. See [Length of stay](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/canada-colombia/traders.html#length-of-stay) for further details. |
| Duties and Job Requirements | These are the activities that the foreign national will be performing. * Do they align with the occupation? * Do they make sense in relation to the trade being proposed? * Are there specific requirements that align with the applicant’s role? * In the case of a trader in an executive or supervisory role, what essential skills are required for the job? |
| Minimum Education Requirements | Are the educational requirements compatible with the stated occupation outlined in the offer of employment? The client’s education may have some bearing on whether the client meets the job requirements; however, its relative weight may be less if their work experience is sufficient. |

Refer to [Employer-specific work permits – General processing – International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html) for further guidance.

### Nationality of the enterprise

The place of incorporation of an enterprise is not an indicator of nationality; **nationality is indicated by ownership**.

Colombian nationality means that the individual or corporate persons who own at least 50 percent interest in the entity (directly or by stock), must hold Colombian citizenship.

If the prospective employer is a corporation or other business organization, the majority ownership must be held by citizens, nationals, or permanent residents of Colombia who either:

*   reside in Colombia; or
*   are maintaining valid temporary resident status in Canada with authorization to work as a trader.

To establish nationality, an officer may consider the following:

*   A letter attesting to ownership from a corporate secretary or a company lawyer may be used in determining nationality;
*   An entity’s shares are sold exclusively on a stock exchange of the country of incorporation, nationality can be presumed to the same; and/or
*   A multinational entity whose shares are exchanged in more than one country will require the applicant to submit evidence that the entity meets the nationality requirement.

The following is not considered to be Colombian nationality:

*   A citizen of Colombia who is a permanent resident of Canada does not qualify as an enterprise of Colombian nationality.
*   Majority ownership of shares of a corporation or other business organization by a citizen of Colombia, who is also a permanent resident of Canada, does not qualify the enterprise as a Colombian nationality.

### Supervisory or executive capacity

The foreign national’s job duties in Canada will be employed in a capacity that is [supervisory, or executive](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#s6) or involves [essential skills](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#e2).

The **supervisory or executive** element of the position must be a principal function of the duties while working in Canada. A supervisor is a manager who is primarily responsible for directing, controlling and guiding subordinate employees and who does not routinely engage in hands-on activities. Note that a first line supervisor would not generally meet these requirements. An executive is in a primary position in the organization with significant policy authority.

Indicators of supervisory or executive capacity are:

*   position title;
*   place in the organizational structure;
*   job duties;
*   degree of ultimate control and responsibility over operations;
*   number and skill levels of immediately subordinate employees over whom supervision is exercised;
*   level of pay commensurate with a senior position; and
*   qualifying executive or supervisory experience.

The size of the entity will dictate which indicators are more significant.

#### Essential skills

[Essential skills](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#e2) or services are special qualifications that are vital to the effectiveness of the firm’s Canadian operations. In general, essential skills are possessed by specialists, not ordinary skilled workers.

The essential employee is not required to have been previously employed by the Colombian enterprise unless the skills required can only be obtained through working for that enterprise.

In assessing essential skills, officers must be satisfied, based upon a consideration of the following factors, that trader status is warranted:

*   the degree of proven expertise of the applicant in the area of specialization;
*   the uniqueness of the special skills.
*   the function of the job;
*   the period of training required to perform the contemplated duties; and
*   a salary commensurate with the special expertise. The salary of an applicant with essential skills should be significantly higher than that of a skilled labourer in the relevant occupation.

### Highly trained technicians

A highly trained technician may sometimes qualify as having essential skills. A highly trained or specially qualified technician employed by a firm to train or to supervise personnel employed in manufacturing, maintenance and repair functions may be granted trader status even though some manual duties may be performed, provided that the firm cannot obtain the services of a qualified Canadian technician.

For example, a qualified technician coming to perform warranty repairs on intricate and complex products sold in trade between Canada and Colombia can be granted trader status if the Canadian entity establishes that it cannot obtain the services of a qualified Canadian technician. It is expected that the firm in Canada will, within a reasonable period of time, locate and train a Canadian as a highly skilled technician. The absence of an effective training program for a Canadian is sufficient reason to refuse repeated requests for a Colombian highly trained technician to occupy a position not requiring essential skills.

### Substantial trade

[Substantial trade](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#s3) is determined by the volume of trade conducted as well as the monetary value of the transactions. Numerous transactions, although each may be small in value, might establish the requisite continuing course of international trade. Officers must be satisfied that the business person’s predominant activity in Canada is international trading.

Trade means the exchange, purchase, or sale of goods and/or services. Goods are tangible commodities or merchandise having intrinsic value, excluding money, securities, and negotiable instruments. Services are economic activities whose outputs are other than tangible goods. Such activities include, but are not limited to international banking, insurance, transportation, communications and data processing, advertising, accounting, design and engineering, management consulting and tourism.

Trade between Colombia and Canada must already be in existence as evidenced by completed sales or binding contracts that call for the immediate exchange of goods or services. An applicant cannot qualify as a Trader for the purpose of searching for a trading relationship.

Final decision
--------------

### Approval

The work permit will be issued under the authority of paragraph[R204(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-204.html).

In GCMS, under the Application screen, officers should enter the information below in the specified fields.

| Field | Selection or input |
| --- | --- |
| Case type | 52 |
| Province of destination | The province of destination entered by the applicant should match the address of employment in the IMP offer of employment. This information is under the **Employment Details – LMIA-exempt**tab. If there is more than one location, officers should enter the primary location in the “Province of destination” field and the secondary location in the “User remarks” field. |
| City of destination | The city of destination entered by the applicant should match the address of employment in the IMP offer of employment. This information is under the **Employment Details – LMIA-exempt**tab. If there is more than one location, officers should enter “Unknown” in the “City of destination” field and “As per the offer” in the “User remarks” field. |
| Exemption code | **F10 –** CCOFTA – R204(a) – Traders This code is auto-populated from the IMP offer of employment. |
| NOC | The NOC code is auto-populated from the IMP offer of employment. |
| Intended occupation | Job title This is auto-populated from the IMP offer of employment. |
| LMIA/LMIA-exempt # | “A” number from the work permit application. This number is auto-populated from the work permit application, and it is what is used to “match” in the Portal. If the work permit application was submitted on paper, the officer must manually enter the number. |
| Employer | Business operating name |
| Duration | Principal applicant: 1 year from the date of entry |

### Refusal

If an officer is not satisfied that all the requirements of [R200](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html), including the assessment under [R204(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-204.html), are met, they must record their reasons and outline the rationale underlying the decision as well as the facts and elements considered. They must also provide an explanation for the decision in a case note.

A decision is reasonable and therefore defendable when another person is able to trace the decision maker’s reasoning, without encountering fatal flaws in the overarching logic, and is satisfied that there is a line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the decision maker’s conclusion.

The officer needs to engage with the documentary evidence that was provided by the applicant. Simply stating ‘I have reviewed the submissions and I am not satisfied that R204 is met’ **is not sufficient** for the another reasonable person to understand the logic of the decision without reviewing all of the evidence again.

Refusal reasons should clearly indicate which criteria or what requirement of R200 was not met and explain how the conclusion was reached.

For assistance, officers can follow the steps in [Decision making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html).

#### Refusal grounds in GCMS

The GCMS has standard text for refusal grounds. Officers should ensure that the refusal grounds selected for the refusal letter match the reasons that they have stated in their case note.

If an officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant is not able to perform the work sought, they should select the paragraph “R200(3)(a)**You were not able to demonstrate that you will be able to adequately perform the work you seek**.” Officers should ensure that they clearly indicate in their refusal notes why they are not satisfied.

Given that there is no specific refusal ground for FTA categories in GCMS for when a officer is not satisfied that the criteria has been met, **they should select the refusal ground “Other” and add a short explanation in the Comments field that they are not satisfied that section R200 or paragraph R204(a) are met.**

Length of stay
--------------

The initial length of stay can have a maximum duration of 1 year.

Extensions should be granted for a duration of 2 years provided that the requirements outlined above are met. Upon receiving a request for extension, the file from the issuing office should be requested to compare the original information and documentation with that presented in support of the extension request.

Spouses and common-law partners (open work permit / LMIA exemption code T25)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Annex 1203: Section E](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/colombia-colombie/fta-ale/12.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=of%20the%20requirement.-,Section%20E%20%E2%80%93%20Spouses,-1.%20Each%20Party)of the CCOFTA includes provisions to facilitate work permit issuance for the spouses or common-law partners of Investors or Traders (F10 or F11), Intra-Company Transferees (F13, F14 or F15), and Professionals and Technicians (F12).

Each party shall grant temporary entry and provide an open work permit to a spouse or common‑law partner of a business person qualifying for temporary entry under the agreement (with the exception of the Business Visitor Category), if the spouse or common-law partner otherwise complies with existing immigration measures applicable to temporary entry. Such an individual should be processed using LMIA exemption code T25.

Spouse or common-law partner open work permits should be issued to the same validity date as the principal applicant or passport expiry, whichever comes first.
