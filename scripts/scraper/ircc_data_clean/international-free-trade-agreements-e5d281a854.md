International Mobility Program: International free trade agreements
===================================================================

**Important:** The LMIA exemption code associated with this work permit category has changed.

Please see [**Labour market impact assessment (LMIA) exemption codes – International Mobility Program**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html) for the **correct codes**

These international free trade agreements (FTAs) contain provisions to facilitate temporary entry for business persons on a reciprocal basis. Eligible persons entering under an FTA will generally require a work permit, but are exempt from requiring a labour market impact assessment (LMIA) as per [paragraph 204(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-204.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR). Business persons entering under an FTA as a business visitor may also be eligible for a work permit exemption as per [paragraph R186(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html).

Under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), professionals are LMIA-exempt under paragraph R204(a) (exemption code T33). Intra-company transferees (ICTs) under GATS are authorized to enter under [the general provisions for ICTs](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/intra-company-transferees.html) and are LMIA-exempt as per [paragraph R205(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-205.html) (exemption codes C61, C62 and C63).
