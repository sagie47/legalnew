Spouses or common-law partners of study permit holders – [R205(c)(ii) –C42] – Canadian interest – International Mobility Program (IMP)
======================================================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

Effective immediately, most foreign nationals in Canada are no longer eligible to apply for a work permit at a port of entry.

The following work permit applications are exempt from the above restrictions and may still be accepted for processing at a port of entry:

*   **applicants who are citizens or permanent residents of the United States of America (USA)**
*   **professionals and technicians under free trade agreements (FTAs)**
    *   professionals under the FTA with the USA and Mexico (T36)
    *   professionals under the FTA with Chile (F22)
    *   contractual service suppliers or independent professionals under the FTA with South Korea (F32)
    *   professionals under the FTA with Panama (F42)
    *   professionals or technicians under the FTA with Colombia (F12)
    *   professionals or technicians under the FTA with Peru (F52)

*   **spouses or common-law partners**of applicants under the FTAs with South Korea (F32), Panama (F42) and Colombia (F12)
*   **truck drivers** who are required to depart Canada for the purpose of their employment and, prior to their departure from Canada, held a work permit or maintained status as a result of a pending application for work permit renewal (this does not include truck drivers operating solely within Canada)
*   **applicants with pre-scheduled Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) appointments**

**Important:** Only spouses or common-law partners of study permit holders are eligible for an open work permit. Their dependent children are **not** eligible to apply for an open work permit under this category (C42).

**Note:** As of January 21, 2025, only spouses of principal foreign nationals in doctorate programs, certain eligible programs or professional programs, and master’s programs of 16 months or longer are eligible for an open work permit. In-Canada spouses of students may seek open work permit renewals, under the criteria that existed when their current work permit was processed, only if they are requesting a permit duration that aligns with the study authorization that the principal foreign national received to complete their current program.

In these instructions, “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).

The instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with the following:

*   [Open work permit – General processing and issuance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html)
*   [Conditions and validity period on work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html)

This International Mobility Program work permit category is intended for spouses and common-law partners who are not, themselves, already study permit holders actively engaged in full-time studies. The reason for allowing spouses to enter Canada and work is to increase the competitiveness of Canada’s academic institutions or economy.

The spouse must have sufficient funds to support themselves and any accompanying dependants separate from the funds used to support the principal foreign national’s study permit application.

**In these instructions, the term “spouse” refers to either a common-law partner or a married spouse.**

### Extension applications

#### If the applicant applied to extend their open work permit before January 21, 2025

Applicants applying for an extension of their open work permit may be eligible under this stream. In such cases, the principal foreign national must continue to [meet the requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c42.html#eligibility) of their initial application.

#### If the applicant has applied to extend their open work permit on or after January 21, 2025

For the applicant to be eligible to extend their open work permit under administrative code C42, the principal foreign national must meet **all** of the following requirements

*   hold a valid study permit
*   be accepted by or enrolled in a PGWP-eligible study program and DLI
*   be physically residing in Canada while studying
*   be studying full-time or have proof of enrolment in full-time courses at a PGWP-eligible DLI
*   be studying in one of the following: 
    *   a master’s program of 16 months or longer
    *   a doctorate program
    *   a professional program
    *   one of the [eligible programs](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/help-your-spouse-common-law-partner-work-canada.html) at a participating DLI

In limited circumstances, spouses of principal foreign nationals studying in the following programs may apply for a work permit renewal under the criteria that were in place when they received their current work permit. This applies to spouses of principal foreign nationals studying in

*   master’s programs of less than 16 months, or
*   college and undergraduate programs

The spouse must be residing in Canada and be requesting an open work permit renewal for a duration that aligns with, and does not exceed, the principal foreign national’s **existing** study authorization.

**Example 1:**

*   If the spouse was given a shorter work permit duration than they originally applied for, due to passport expiry, they may still benefit from a work permit renewal, as noted above.

**Example 2:**

*   If the principal foreign national needs more time (for example, for their thesis) and a study permit extension is needed to complete their **current** program, spouses may still benefit from a work permit renewal, as noted above. However, the spouse’s application for their work permit extension can be assessed only once the principal foreign national receives the approval of their study permit extension. 

**Note:**If the principal foreign national applies for a study permit for a new level or program of study, the spouse of the principal foreign national, noted above, is not eligible to extend their work permit under administrative code C42.

Those who do not meet the new eligibility criteria or qualify for an extension can apply for a new work permit from within Canada under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program or another stream of the International Mobility Program, if eligible.

Documentary evidence
--------------------

With the application for an open work permit, officers should be satisfied that they have the following documentary evidence to make an assessment.

**All applications must have the following documentation:**

*   proof that the principal foreign national is enrolled in or attending a PGWP-eligible study [program and DLI](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/designated-learning-institutions.html)
*   proof that other requirements of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and the IRPR are met, for example, sufficient funds (housing costs, daily living expenses, etc.) to support themselves that are separate from those of the principal foreign national

**Additional documentation is required as per the specific dates below**

### Applications submitted before March 19, 2024

*   proof that the principal foreign national is studying or is enrolled (if applying from outside Canada as a family group) in full-time studies in a PGWP-eligible study program **and** institution such as 
    *   a Canadian public post-secondary institution, such as a 
        *   college
        *   trade or technical school
        *   university
        *   CEGEP in Quebec

    *   a Canadian private institution authorized by provincial statute to confer degrees (for example, a bachelor’s, master’s, or doctorate), where the study permit holder is enrolled in such a program 
        *   The private institution remains eligible even if it is not authorized to confer degrees for all study programs on offer.

If the principal foreign national is enrolled in a private post-secondary program or at an institution other than those listed above, the spouse is not eligible for a spousal open work permit.

Application assessment
----------------------

Officers should be satisfied that the principal foreign national continues to comply with the study permit conditions, including those under section[R220.1](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-220.1.html?txthl=220.1). Should officers have any concerns, they may wish to request additional information from the applicant to ensure that the eligibility requirements of the work permit category (administrative code C42) are met, or they may undertake an assessment to ensure the material documents provided in the spousal open work permit application are bona fide.

Foreign nationals who are eligible for processing under administrative code C42 are subject to all other eligibility and admissibility requirements (including section[A39](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-2.5/section-39.html)) under the IRPA and the IRPR.

Officers must be satisfied that all eligibility requirements **are met at the time of the decision** on the spousal work permit application.

If officers have any concerns as to the genuineness of the documents provided, they may wish to undertake an assessment to ensure this material information is genuine and does not reflect a misrepresentation of facts to appear eligible for the permit.

### Principal foreign nationals

The principal foreign national is the first foreign national of the couple who obtained a study or work permit or was deemed authorized to work under the provisions of section R186, other than under paragraphs R186(v) or (w).

In assessing eligibility for a spousal open work permit, the principal foreign national continues to remain the principal in the couple.

The principal foreign national cannot obtain a spousal open work permit under the work permit categories provided under the administrative codes C41, C42, C47 or C49 based on the dependent spouse’s spousal open work permit and Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER) category.

For example, if the principal foreign national is a study permit holder and the dependent spouse obtains an open work permit under administrative code C42 for spouses of study permit holders, the study permit holder cannot quit their studies and obtain a work permit in the C41 spousal category on the basis of their spouse’s C42 open work permit and employment.

### Genuine relationship

In accordance with [section R4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-4.html), a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse or a common-law partner of a person if the marriage or common-law partnership either

*   was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the IRPA, or
*   is not genuine.

If officers have concerns as to the genuineness of the relationship, to be procedurally fair, they should request further documentation or information to confirm that the relationship between the dependent spouse and the principal foreign national is genuine and is not a relationship of convenience. Procedural fairness means giving the applicant the opportunity to respond to the concerns of the officer prior to any decision.

If the officer believes that the applicant has misrepresented themselves, the officer should follow the instructions for proceeding with a determination.

### Final decision

#### Approval

The work permit will be issued under the authority of subparagraph R205(c)(ii).

In GCMS, under the “Application” screen, officers should enter the information below in the specified fields.

If the principal foreign national is authorized to study without a permit under [section R189](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-189.html) at the time the spouse’s work permit application is submitted, the spousal application should be placed on hold until the principal foreign national’s study permit extension application is finalized. |

#### Refusals

If an officer is not satisfied that all the requirements of section R200, including the assessment under subparagraph R205(c)(ii), are met, they must record their reasons and outline the rationale underlying the decision as well as the facts and elements considered in a case note.

Refusal reasons should clearly indicate which criteria or what requirements of section R200 were not met and explain how the conclusion was reached. For assistance, officers can follow the steps in [Decision-making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html).

For example, if the applicant does not have sufficient funds to support themselves, the officer can indicate that paragraph R200(1)(b) is not met, as they are not satisfied that the applicant would be able to support themselves during their stay and pay for their departure from Canada given that an open work permit does not guarantee employment in Canada during the period of authorized stay. Therefore, they are not satisfied that the applicant will leave Canada at the end of their authorized stay.
