*   court records and transcript

A recommendation for a TRP should include

*   the duration for which the permit should be issued
*   any conditions that may be imposed 
*   whether the permit should be valid for re-entering Canada

Documenting decisions
---------------------

In addition to documenting decisions on file, application/client notes should be entered in GCMS for the TRP document. This will ensure proper documentation of all inadmissibilities and give officers all information needed before deciding on a subsequent permit or future application.
