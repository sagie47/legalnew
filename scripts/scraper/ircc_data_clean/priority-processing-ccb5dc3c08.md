Priority processing for temporary workers in essential occupations
==================================================================

The instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with the following:

*   [Employer-specific work permits with Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) exemptions (International Mobility Program)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html)
*   [Labour Market Impact Assessment Review](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/validity-suspension-duration-employment.html)
*   [Conditions and validity period on work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html)
*   [Public list of Employers who have been non-compliant](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/public-list-employers-who-have-been-non-compliant.html)

To strengthen Canada’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and lay the foundation for our long-term economic growth, applications from foreign nationals working within essential services will continue to be prioritized.

**Note:** Work permit applicants eligible for the [urgent referrals process for work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/urgent-referrals.html) should continue to be processed on a priority basis, where operationally feasible.

Where operationally possible, offices are encouraged to prioritize work permit applications for occupations with NOC codes related to agricultural, agri-food and health care as these occupations have been identified as essential and critical for Canada.

**Note:** Starting November 16, 2022, IRCC is switching to the [2021 version of the NOC system](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/?GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA). At that time, foreign nationals will begin using the NOC 2021 codes in their applications.

A daily report is being pulled by the Operations Planning and Performance Branch (OPPB) and distributed to the International and Centralized Networks to ensure the following NOC codes related to work permit applications **are prioritized:**

| NOC 2016 codes | NOC 2021 codes |
| --- | --- |
| NOC 6331 – Butchers, meat cutters and fishmongers – retail and wholesale | NOC 63201 – Butchers – retail and wholesale NOC 65202 – Meat cutters and fishmongers – retail and wholesale |

| NOC 9462 – Industrial butchers and meat cutters, poultry preparers and related workers | NOC 94141 – Industrial butchers and meat cutters, poultry preparers and related workers |

**Note:** While applications in certain sectors are being prioritized based on NOC codes, this **does not** preclude an officer from prioritizing a case (should all processing requirements be met and operational capacity allow) where there is a demonstrated urgent need for the worker in Canada.
