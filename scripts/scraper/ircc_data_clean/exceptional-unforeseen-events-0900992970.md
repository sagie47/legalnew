Exceptional and Unforeseen Events – Provincial agreements [R204(c) – T13] – Agreements and arrangements – International Mobility Program
========================================================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

In these instructions “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).

The instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with

*   [Employer-specific work permits with Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) exemptions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html)
*   [Conditions and validity period on work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html)
*   [Public list of Employers who have been non-compliant](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/public-list-employers-who-have-been-non-compliant.html)

In this situation, “province” legally refers to provinces and territories. Therefore, in these instructions, when “province” is used, it refers to both provinces and territories.

An Exceptional and Unforeseen Event is defined as a temporary situation during or following an event that poses a significant risk to people’s lives, health, general safety, property or the environment. For instance, one such event could be an earthquake.

IRCC is responsible for assessing proposals or requests under the agreements for exceptional and unforeseen events from provinces in accordance with the criteria outlined in their respective foreign worker agreement or annex. The proposals or requests are **event-based** and, as such, will vary in duration and from one jurisdiction to another.

The Exceptional and Unforeseen Events provision allows provinces to provide a letter of support for the issuance of a work permit that would otherwise not be covered under existing LMIA exemptions or work permit exemptions in the Immigration Refugee Protection Regulations.

[Emergency service providers](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/authorization-work-without-work-permit-emergency-service-providers.html), including medical service personnel, who meet the requirements of a work permit exemption under [R186(t)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) can enter Canada for the purpose of providing services in times of emergency (such as natural disasters).

Provincial proposals for LMIA exemptions under the Exceptional and Unforeseen Events provisions **must be approved by IRCC**. Once they are approved, the province or territory will provide the applicant with the LMIA exemption support letter.

General eligibility
-------------------

There are presently no approved situations under the Exceptional and Unforeseen Events sections in the Federal-Provincial Agreements.

Documentary evidence
--------------------

The following are required before a work permit application can be approved:

*   a provincial letter of support containing details such as 
    *   the full name and date of birth of the individual selected
    *   information about the employer 
        *   name of employer
        *   occupation 
        *   duration of employment

*   an LMIA-exempt offer of employment submitted in the Employer Portal (A#######) or through an **approved**[alternate submission](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html#t4) of the IMM 5802 form 
    *   Including a proof of employer compliance fee payment (such as the receipt number) unless an alternate submission was approved and the employer is exempt.

**Note:** Foreign nationals seeking to enter Canada under a provincial or territorial agreement pursuant to section R204(c) are still required to meet all other requirements under the Immigration Refugee Protection Act and the Immigration Refugee Protection Regulations.

Work permit issuance in the Global Case Management System (GCMS)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Given the time-sensitive nature of the LMIA-exempt work permits required in relation to Exceptional and Unforeseen Events, officers are instructed to process work permit applications on an urgent basis.

Under the Application screen for employer-specific work permits, enter the information below.

| Field | Selection or input |
| --- | --- |
| Case type | 52– Employer-specific LMIA-exempt applications * The Case type field must indicate “52” if there is an offer of employment in the Employer Portal. No other case type will allow the correct linkage in the system. Entering a case type other than “52” will result in incorrect accounting, requiring manual corrections to be made and making inspection activities more difficult. * **Only** if an [alternate submission](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html#t4) has been approved, meaning there is a note on the Client screen, case type “20” may be used. This case type should not be used as a workaround. |
| Province of destination | * This is the province approved for the LMIA exemption under Exceptional and Unforeseen Events. |
| City of destination | * If there is more than 1 location, enter the main municipality in this field and the secondary location in User Remarks. For more information on multiple job locations, see [these instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html#t5.1). |
| Exemption code | T13 * This code will auto-populate when the work permit is properly matched with the offer of employment. * Officers must manually enter this code if an alternate submission is approved. |
| NOC | National Occupational Classification code * The NOC code will auto-populate when the work permit is properly matched with the offer of employment. * Officers must manually enter this code if an alternate submission is approved. |
| Intended occupation | Job title * The job title will auto-populate when the work permit is properly matched with the offer of employment. * Officers must manually enter the occupation if an alternate submission is approved. |
| Employer | Business operating name * The business operating name will auto-populate when the work permit is properly matched with the offer of employment. * Officers must manually enter the name from the IMM 5802 if an alternate submission is approved. |
| Duration | The duration of the work permit should not exceed 120 days. |
| Notes **(Mandatory)** | Enter “Canada-(insert provincial foreign worker annex or agreement)-Exceptional and Unforeseen Events” in the Case Notes. |
