Application Assessment
----------------------

### Review of the offer of employment

When assessing if the work permit application meets the requirements for a CCOFTA professional or technician, officers should review the offer of employment that appears under the Employment Details tab in the Global Case Management System (GCMS) for information provided by the employer or the matching fields on the IMM 5802 form (if the employer was authorized to use it).

| Field | Considerations |
| --- | --- |
| LMIA Exemption | **F12** – CCOFTA – R204(a) – Professionals and Technicians |
| Requirements Exemptions Met | Information in this field outlines how the job and the foreign national meet the regulatory and trade agreement requirements, including that the applicant: Professionals * will work in a TEER 0 or 1, occupation (or[NOC 0, or A occupation](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/)) * is included in the[List of eligible professions under the CCOFTA Professionals and technicians category](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/canada-colombia/professionals-technicians.html#s7) * hold a post-secondary degree in a specialty requiring 4 or more years of study as a minimum for entry into the occupations (as defined by the NOC) Technicians * will work in a TEER 2 or 3 occupation ([NOC B](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/)) * are required to hold a post-secondary or technical degree requiring 1 or more years of study (or equivalent of such a degree) as a minimum for the speciality occupation (as defined by the NOC) |
| NOC and Job Title | Ensure that the occupational code and title are in the appropriate TEER for the occupation capacity. |
| Duration | 3 year maximum on initial document, extensions are possible |
| Employer | Does the offer of employment provide confirmation of the pre-arranged employment? Is the proposed employer in Canada? Does the offer of employment give accurate details of the profession for which entry is sought: * title * duties * duration of employment * arrangements as to payment? |
| Duties and Job Requirements | These are the activities that the foreign national will be performing. * Do they align with the occupation? * Are there specific requirements that align with the professional or technician category of the applicant? * Does the employer require more than the minimum amount of paid work experience? |
| Wages | **Note:**A mandatory wage assessment is not required for applicants under this category. However, for these applicants, wage remains an important indicator of knowledge, expertise and experience and should be taken into account as an important factor in an officer’s overall assessment, although officers should not refuse an application based on the wage alone. There is no requirement that the foreign national be paid by the Canadian[enterprise](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#e1)or in Canadian dollars. |
| Minimum Education Requirements | Do the educational requirements outlined in the offer of employment align with the minimum education requirements of the professional or technician category? Are there additional or alternative requirements for this occupation defined in the NOC? |
| Other Training Required | The employer may indicate specialty training as a requirement. |
| Provincial/Federal Certification, Licensing or Registration | The employer should list any specific certification, licensing or registration required in Canada. Documented evidence should be provided with the application if the occupation is regulated by the province or territory; however, some occupations may require the foreign national to write an exam after they enter Canada, for example, for a licence from a regulated body or a first aid certificate. |

Refer to [Employer-specific work permits – General processing – International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html) for further guidance.

### Pre-arranged employment

In this context, the Canadian employer may be an [enterprise](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#e1) or an individual. The following are some examples of pre-arranged employment:

*   an employee-employer relationship with a Canadian enterprise; or
*   a contract between the professional and a Canadian enterprise; or
*   a contract between the professional’s Colombian employer and a Canadian enterprise.

**Important:** The professionals and technicians category does not allow self-employment in Canada (i.e., soliciting business in the Canadian labour market). However, a Colombian citizen who is self-employed outside Canada is not barred from the professionals and technicians category, provided the services to be rendered in Canada are pre-arranged with a Canadian employer .

### Self-employment

If the Canadian enterprise is substantially controlled by the applicant, it is considered to be self-employment. For example, if the Canadian enterprise offering the employment is a sole proprietorship operated by the applicant, then entry cannot be granted under the Professionals and technicians category. Additionally, if the Canadian enterprise is legally distinct from the applicant, for example, a legal corporate entity but the entity is substantially controlled by the applicant, entry as a professional or technician must also be refused.

In order to determine if an enterprise is substantially controlled, the following factors must be taken into account:

*   whether the applicant has established the business;
*   whether the applicant has primary, sole, or de facto control of the business;
*   whether the applicant is the primary, sole, or de facto owner of the business;
*   whether the applicant is the primary, sole, or de facto recipient of income of the business.

When a professional or technician applies for a renewal of a work permit, the following activities may indicate that the applicant has been self-employed in Canada:

*   incorporation of a company in Canada expressly for the purpose of the business person being self-employed (incorporating does not automatically signify self-employment; the motives for incorporation need to be examined before making a determination);
*   initiation of communications (e.g., “job hunting” by direct mail or by advertising);
*   responding to advertisements for the purpose of obtaining employment or contracts; or
*   establishing an office which serves as a way to advertise (i.e., a “sign or a shingle” outside the door).

The following activities do not constitute self-employment:

*   responding to unsolicited inquiries about the service which the professional or technician may be able to perform; or
*   establishing an office from which to deliver pre-arranged service to clients.

### Occupational qualifications

A professional or technician must be entering Canada to provide professional level services in an eligible occupation for which they are qualified. In making this determination, both the qualification of the individual and the position in Canada must be considered. actually work in that profession in Canada.

For [regulated professions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/regulated-certified-occupations.html), the officer must be satisfied that the professional has or can obtain the necessary licensing so that the applicant may [perform the work sought](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/prohibitions.html#unable-perform).

In instances where a baccalaureate degree is required, the degree should be in the specific field or in a closely related field. Baccalaureate degrees (or licenciatura) need not have been obtained in colleges or universities in Canada or Colombia, whereas post secondary diplomas or certificates should have been earned in one of the two CCOFTA countries.

It is possible for a professional or technician to be working in Canada on more than one contract at a time. A work permit must be issued for each individual contract.

### Training

Professionals and technicians with a valid work permit can provide training related to their profession, including conducting seminars.

The training session must be pre-arranged with a Canadian employer and the subject matter must be at the professional level. Entry does not allow seminar leaders to engage in training that is not pre-arranged with a Canadian employer.

The training must form part of the professional training or development of the participants and must be related to their job duties.

Final decision
--------------

### Approval

The work permit will be issued under the authority of paragraph [R204(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-204.html).

In GCMS, under the Application screen, officers should enter the information below in the specified fields.

| Field | Selection or input |
| --- | --- |
| Case type | 52 |
| Province of destination | The province of destination entered by the applicant should match the address of employment in the IMP offer of employment. This information is under the **Employment Details – LMIA-exempt** tab. If there is more than one location, officers should enter the primary location in the “Province of destination” field and the secondary location in the “User remarks” field. |
| City of destination | The province of destination entered by the applicant should match the address of employment in the IMP offer of employment. This information is under the **Employment Details – LMIA-exempt** tab. If there is more than one location, officers should enter “Unknown” in the “City of destination” field and “As per the offer” in the “User remarks” field. |
| Exemption code | **F12** – CCOFTA – R204(a) – Professionals and technicians This code is auto-populated from the IMP offer of employment. |
| NOC | The NOC code is auto-populated from the IMP offer of employment. |
| Intended occupation | Job title This is auto-populated from the IMP offer of employment. |
| LMIA/LMIA-exempt # | “A” number from the work permit application. This number is auto-populated from the work permit application, and it is what is used to “match” in the Portal. If the work permit application was submitted on paper, the officer must manually enter the number. |
| Employer | Business operating name |
| Duration | Officers may issue a work permit that is valid for the duration of the offer of employment or until the expiry of the travel document, whichever is earlier. Refer to [Validity period for work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html#validity). |

**Note:** If the employer is authorized to use an IMM 5802 form instead of completing the offer of employment through the [Employer Portal, please see Employer-specific work permits – General processing – International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html).

### Refusal

If an officer is not satisfied that all the requirements of [R200](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html), including the assessment under [R204(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-204.html), are met, they must record their reasons and outline the rationale underlying the decision as well as the facts and elements considered. They must also provide an explanation for the decision in a case note.

A decision is reasonable and therefore defendable when another person is able to trace the decision maker’s reasoning, without encountering fatal flaws in the overarching logic, and is satisfied that there is a line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the decision maker’s conclusion.

The officer needs to engage with the documentary evidence that was provided by the applicant. Simply stating “I have reviewed the submissions and I am not satisfied that R204 is met” **is not sufficient** for another reasonable person to understand the logic of the decision without reviewing all of the evidence again.

Refusal reasons should clearly indicate which criteria or what requirement of R200 was not met and explain how the conclusion was reached.

For assistance, officers can follow the steps in [Decision making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html).

### Refusal grounds in the GCMS

The GCMS has standard text for refusal grounds. Officers should ensure that the refusal grounds selected for the refusal letter match the reasons that they have stated in their case note.

If an officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant is not able to perform the work sought, they should select the paragraph “R200(3)(a) **You were not able to demonstrate that you will be able to adequately perform the work you seek**.” Officers should ensure that they clearly indicate in their refusal notes why they are not satisfied.

Given that there is no specific refusal ground for FTA categories in GCMS for when an officer is not satisfied that the criteria has been met, **they should select the refusal ground “Other” and add a short explanation in the Comments field that they are not satisfied that section R200 or paragraph R204(a) are met**.

Length of stay
--------------

Initial work permits can be granted for a duration of up to 3 years.

Extensions can also be issued in increments of up to 3 years with no limit on the number of extensions providing the individual continues to comply with the requirements for professionals and technicians.

Officers must be satisfied that the employment is still “temporary” and that the foreign national is not using the CCOFTA as a means of circumventing normal immigration procedures.

Spouses and common-law partners (open work permit / LMIA exemption code T25)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Annex 1203: Section E](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/colombia-colombie/fta-ale/12.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=of%20the%20requirement.-,Section%20E%20%E2%80%93%20Spouses,-1.%20Each%20Party)of the CCOFTA includes provisions to facilitate work permit issuance for the spouses or common-law partners of Investors or Traders (F10 or F11), Intra-Company Transferees (F13, F14 or F15), and Professionals and Technicians (F12).

Each party shall grant temporary entry and provide an open work permit to a spouse or common‑law partner of a business person qualifying for temporary entry under the agreement (with the exception of the Business Visitor Category), if the spouse or common-law partner otherwise complies with existing immigration measures applicable to temporary entry. Such an individual should be processed using LMIA exemption code T25.
