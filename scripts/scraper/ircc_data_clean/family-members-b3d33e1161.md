Family members of military personnel – [R205(b) – C20] or spouses of military personnel if there is no reciprocal agreement [R205(c) – C41]: International Mobility Program
===========================================================================================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

In these instructions, “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).

In these instructions, “[designated civilian](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/countries-designated-purposes-visiting-forces-act.html)” describes personnel of the designated states under the [Visiting Forces Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-99-86/page-1.html?wbdisable=true) (VFA) who have been designated as a civilian component of a visiting force.

The instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with the following:

*   [Open work permit – General processing and issuance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html)

The family members of military personnel and designated civilians coming to Canada for the purposes of the [Visiting Forces Act (VFA)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/V-2/index.html) may be eligible for an open work permit for the same duration as their military family member’s tour of duty in Canada.

Eligibility
-----------

### Reciprocal agreements eligibility [paragraph R205(b)]

To be eligible as a family member of a foreign national entering Canada under [paragraph R205(b)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-205.html) of the VFA, administrative code C20, the family member must

*   be the genuine spouse, common-law partner or dependent child of the military member or designated civilian component
*   have received approval in principle from the Department of National Defence (DND)

No reciprocal agreement eligibility [paragraph R205(c)(ii)]
-----------------------------------------------------------

Spouses or common-law partners of military members or designated civilian components **not** covered by a reciprocal agreement (i.e., do not have an approval in principle letter from DND) may apply for an open work permit as the spouse of a foreign national authorized to work under paragraph R205(c)(ii), administrative code C41. See [Eligibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/spouses-common-law-authorized-work-high-skilled-occupations.html#s1).

The administrative code to be used would depend on the [National Occupational Classification](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/?GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA) training, education, experience and requirements (TEER) category of the principal military family member.

Military occupations are as follows:

*   [40042](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/Structure/NOCProfile?GocTemplateCulture=en-CA&code=40042&version=2021.0) - Commissioned officers of the Canadian Armed Forces (**TEER 0**) - spouses are eligible to apply for an open work permit under [C41](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/spouses-common-law-authorized-work-high-skilled-occupations.html).

**Note:**[44200](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/Structure/Hierarchy?objectid=5osMZHeG69CPWGszbkHvHZLix6grx5XKt6yTii4fQl8%3d&GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA) - Primary combat members of the Canadian Armed Forces (**TEER 4**) - the NOC is TEER 4; therefore, spouses of principal military are **not** eligible to apply for an open work permit under [C47](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c47-c48.html).

Dependent children are **not** eligible to apply for an open work permit if the work permit application was received by IRCC or the CBSA on or after January 21, 2025.

For eligibility requirements and processing, see the applicable instructions:

*   [Spouses or common-law partners of foreign nationals authorized to work in high-skilled occupations TEER 0 or 1, or select occupations TEER 2 or 3) - [C41]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/spouses-common-law-authorized-work-high-skilled-occupations.html)

### Refusals

When officers are not satisfied that the specific eligibility factors for this administrative code are met, they need to clearly document their reasons in the refusal note.

A decision is reasonable when the reviewing court is able to trace the decision maker’s rationale without encountering fatal flaws in the overarching logic and is satisfied that there is a line of analysis within the given reasons that could lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the decision maker’s conclusion.

The officer needs to engage with the documentary evidence that was provided by the applicant. Simply stating, “I have reviewed the submissions, and I am not satisfied that section R205(b) [or section R205(c)] is met”, is not sufficient for another reasonable person to understand the logic of the decision without reviewing all of the evidence again.

If an officer has determined that the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements, the work permit application should be refused. Officers should follow the steps in [Decision-making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html) when finalizing their refusal notes.

The grounds in the refusal letter should reflect what the officer has stated in their notes.

Work permits shall be issued if all of the requirements stated in [section R200](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html) are met. Therefore, refusal grounds should be linked to one of those requirements. Below is an example of the requirements:

*   **R200(1)(c)(ii)** - The applicant has not met the eligibility requirements of the International Mobility Program work permit category. Officers need to explain clearly what eligibility requirements were not met.
*   **For example:** The spouse is applying under R205(c)(ii) for a C41 open work permit. The principal foreign national holds a work permit that is valid for a period of less than 16 months **after** the receipt date of the spousal open work permit application. The work permit application should be refused under subparagraph R200(1)(c)(ii), since their work is not described in section R205. The applicant has not provided proof showing the principal foreign national is authorized (that the work permit issued) or is provisionally approved (that the letter of introduction was issued) to work in Canada for a period of 16 months or longer **after** the receipt date of the spousal open work permit application. They do not meet the eligibility requirements that would make their work described in section R205.
