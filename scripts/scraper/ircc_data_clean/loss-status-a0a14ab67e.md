Temporary residents: Loss of status
===================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

Foreign nationals lose their temporary resident (TR) status ([A47](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-190.html?term=190)):

*   at the end of the period for which they were authorized to remain in Canada;
*   on a determination by an officer or the Immigration Division that they have failed to comply with any other requirement of the Act; or
*   on cancellation of their temporary resident permit (TRP).

**Note:** Holders of the Parent and Grandparent Extended Stay Temporary Resident Visa ([Super Visa](https://www.canada.ca/fr/immigration-refugies-citoyennete/organisation/publications-guides/bulletins-guides-operationnels/residents-temporaires/visiteurs/super-visa.html)) also lose their status if they stay beyond their authorized period.
