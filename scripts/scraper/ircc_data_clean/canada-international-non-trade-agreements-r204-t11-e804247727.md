Canada–International Non-Trade Agreements [R204(a) – T11] – Agreements or arrangements – International Mobility Program
=======================================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

Canada has negotiated a number of international instruments with other countries—pertaining to subjects other than trade—in the form of agreements ([treaties](https://treaty-accord.gc.ca/index.aspx)) that intend to create international obligations for Canada and the other signatory country, or cooperation arrangements such as Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs), which are a non-binding type of instrument.

**Note:**Not included under these non-trade agreements are diplomatic agreements with United Nations Organizations, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). Persons entering under diplomatic agreements may be facilitated under R186(b). (See[Foreign representatives, family members and domestic workers](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/foreign-representatives.html).)

Their stay in Canada may be for many years and consequently long-term work permits may be issued pursuant to R204.

These organizations enjoy special status under the [Foreign Missions and International Organizations Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/F-29.4/) and are therefore exempt from the employer compliance regime. As Canada is a State Member of each organization it follows that Canadian citizens are eligible to apply for the respective internship programs.

Individuals are provided with copies of the International Assignment Agreement as it relates to their assignments and should be in possession of their agreement when seeking entry.

Fields of cooperation may vary from year to year.

### Telefilm

Telefilm administers coproduction agreements on the Canadian government's behalf. The official coproduction agreements enable Canadian producers and their foreign counterparts to pool their creative, artistic, technical and financial resources to co-produce films and television programs that enjoy the status of national productions in each of the countries concerned.

See [Film co-producers](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/arts/occupations.html) for more information on document requirements and Telefilm guidelines.

### U.S. government personnel

Official U.S. government personnel assigned to work in Canada temporarily and their eligible family members may be eligible for a labour market impact assessment (LMIA)-exempt work permit.

See[United States government personnel](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/unique-situations/united-states-government-personnel.html) for more information.

**Note:**Instances may occur where workers come forward under a valid agreement that may not be on the list. In such cases, admission should be facilitated if workers can satisfy the officer that there is an agreement that covers their admission. Family members may be eligible for open work permits.
