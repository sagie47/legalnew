Labour market impact assessment (LMIA) exemption codes – International Mobility Program(IMP)
============================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

Sections 204 to 208 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) provide the regulatory authority to issue a work permit to a worker who does not require a labour market impact assessment (LMIA) as per [subparagraphs R200(1)(c)(i) to (ii.1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html).

There are specific situations that Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) considers, by policy, as meeting the requirements of sections R204 through R208. In doing so, the department has created LMIA exemption streams (via unique administrative codes) to identify the different eligibilities or criteria for those specific situations. Meeting the eligibility criteria to be assessed under a LMIA-exemption category only means the applicant does not require a LMIA for their application to be processed. The officer must still be satisfied that all regulatory requirements are met for the issuance of a work permit, including all relevant factors of section R200.

The LMIA exemption codes are listed in the following tables.

**Important:** There were several code changes and new codes added on December 15, 2022. Officers should ensure that they are using the correct coding based on the specific work permit category instructions.
