Public policy: Open work permits for applicants under the temporary resident to permanent resident pathway
==========================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

The temporary public policy to exempt certain permanent resident applicants from work permit requirements is extended until December 31, 2026.

Applicants can extend their work permit until December 31, 2026. Updates to the program delivery instructions are to follow.

The client instructions page have been updated:

[Temporary public policies: Open work permits for applicants under the temporary resident to permanent resident pathway](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/tr-pr-pathway/open-work-permit.html)

[Temporary public policies](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/tr-pr-pathway.html) aiming to transition foreign nationals already living and working in Canada to permanent residence were announced on April 14, 2021 and launched on May 6, 2021.

To support these permanent resident public policies, the [Temporary public policy to exempt certain permanent residence applicants from work permit requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/exempt-certain-permanent-residence-applicants-work-permit.html) was signed on July 4. 2021, to provide exemptions from certain requirements of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) to facilitate the issuance of open work permits to eligible individuals in Canada. Eligible family members may also apply for an open work permit.

A subsequent [public policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/exempt-pr-applicants-work-permit-requirements-dec-2024.html)on issuing open work permits was signed on April 21, 2022, and expired on December 31,2024.

The [new public policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/exempt-pr-applicants-work-permit-requirements-dec-2024.html)

*   allows the issuance of open work permits with a longer duration (until December 31,2026) to avoid the need for renewals
*   expands the eligibility criteria of the open work permit public policy to include eligible family members abroad to help speed up family reunification

This replacement public policy will be applied retroactively to pending applications for a work permit made under the initial public policy, as well as all applications received after the date that this public policy takes effect.

Processing open work permit applications
----------------------------------------

Officers should use a work permit expiry date of December 31,2026.

Open work permit applications will be processed by the Immigration Operations Branch.

**Note:** Not all mandatory documents are requested in the online document checklist. Applicants are given instructions on the IRCC website on how to identify the permanent residence stream they applied under and where to upload the supporting documentation when they apply online.

Officers should note that applicants are given specific instructions on how to complete the Application to Change Conditions, Extend my Stay or Remain in Canada as a Worker [IMM 5710]. Applicants instructions can be found at [Temporary public policies: Open work permits for applicants under the temporary resident to permanent resident pathway](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/tr-pr-pathway/open-work-permit.html).

**Important:** Officers should be aware that

*   the “Job title” box on the IMM 5710 form maps to the “Intended occupation” field in GCMS

**Important:** If this fee is paid in error, it must be refunded as per the processing office’s normal refund procedures.

Eligibility requirements for spouses, common-law partners and dependent children
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be eligible for an open work permit under this public policy, family members must

*   have submitted an open work permit application online through an IRCC Secure Account and included the UCI of their principal family member in the work permit application
*   be in Canada when they submit their work permit application
*   be a genuine family member as described in subsection R1(3) of a principal applicant who has applied for and been found eligible for an open work permit under this public policy. 
    *   ‘Family member’ is defined as; 
        *   a spouse or common-law partner
        *   dependent child of principal applicant or their spouse or common-law partner
        *   dependent child of a dependent child

*   have been included as an accompanying family member in the principal applicant’s permanent residence application
*   be 18 years of age or older at the time the work permit application is submitted
*   must have a valid temporary resident status or be eligible to restore their temporary resident status if they are in Canada at the time of submission.

If the principal applicant is not eligible for an open work permit under the temporary resident to permanent resident pathway public policy, the processing officer will also refuse the work permit applications. If the work permit application of the principal applicant is refused, family members who submitted an open work permit under this public policy would no longer be eligible for an open work permit under the public policy and their work permit application should be refused. and any other temporary residence applications for family members and send a refusal letter to the applicants.

Applicants overseas are instructed to submit their application online using the application form for applicants outside Canada. They are subject to all requirements for overseas applicants.

Applicants are required to check the migration office’s specific requirements to make sure all required documents are included in their online application.

### Documentary evidence

With the application for a spouse’s or dependent child’s open work permit, the applicant should provide the following, in addition to the other supporting documents requested when submitting an online application:

*   proof of relationship (for example, marriage certificate, declaration of common-law relationship, birth certificate that shows both parents’ names)
*   a copy of the IMM 0008 form for the permanent residence application in which the principal applicant listed the name of their family members 

### What is a genuine relationship

As per [section R4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-4.html), a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse or a common-law partner of a person if the marriage or common-law partnership either

*   was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act
*   is not genuine

If officers have any concerns as to the genuineness of the relationship, they may request further documentation or information to confirm that the relationship between the dependent spouse or common-law partner and the principal foreign national is genuine and is not a relationship of convenience.

### Processing of family groups

For applicant instructions for family members, see: [Temporary public policies: Open work permits for applicants under the temporary resident to permanent resident pathway](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/tr-pr-pathway/open-work-permit.html)

#### Applications for whole family submitted together

The CPC-E is responsible for processing in-Canada applications (for principal applicants and in-Canada family members) whether the applications were submitted as a group or separately.

Family groups where the principal applicant is in Canada and family members are outside of Canada will be triaged automatically to the CPC-E.

The CPC-E will only process the principal applicant’s application. Applications for outside of Canada family members will be referred to the appropriate migration office for processing.

If the principal applicant is eligible for an open work permit under the TR to PR pathway public policy, CPC- E will:

*   approve the principal applicant’s work permit application
*   refer the overseas family members to the appropriate migration office. CPC E will follow the existing process they have for this procedure.
*   Add a Case Note to the family members’ application: “Principal applicant is eligible for an open work permit under the TRPR pathway public policy. Referred to [migration office] for processing and final decision.” 
    *   The officer **must add** the ORG ID code for family members before transferring the applications to the relevant migration office.

If the work permit application of the principal applicant is refused, family members who submitted an open work permit under this public policy would no longer be eligible for an open work permit and their work permit application should be refused.

#### Applications for family submitted separately

Dependants who did not include their temporary residence application in a family group with the principal applicant’s application can only submit their application after the principal applicant receives the open work permit.

In such cases, dependants must upload a copy of the principal applicant’s work permit in the “Client Information” field or ‘Proof of family member status’ when they apply online through the IRCC secure account (MyCIC Account).

If migration offices receive an online application from dependants overseas and the CPC-E has **already issued** an open work permit to the principal applicant, the appropriate migration office can make a final decision on the temporary residence application.

If the dependants are eligible to apply for temporary residence after entry and they used the in-Canada form, the CPC-E or local office will process the application and make the final decision as per the regular procedure.

### Open work permit issuance for family members

On the “Application screen”, officers should enter the following information in the specified fields:

| Field | Selection or input |
| --- | --- |
| Case type | 20 |
| Province of destination | Open |
| City of destination | Open |
