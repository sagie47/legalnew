Post-graduation work permit (PGWP) [R205(c) - C43] – International Mobility Program
===================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

As of November 1, 2024, eligibility criteria will be dependent on when the student submitted their study permit application and when they applied for their post-graduation work permit (PGWP), with the exception of flight school graduates, whose eligibility criteria remain unchanged. The changes include language proficiency requirements and, in some cases, requirements based on field of study.

In these instructions, the term “officers” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency.

The instructions on this page should be reviewed with the following:

*   [Open work permit – General processing and issuance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html)
*   [Conditions and validity period on work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html)

The Minister designated as necessary the work performed by foreign nationals who have graduated from an eligible program and designated learning institution in Canada for public policy reasons related to the competitiveness of Canada’s academic institutions or economy, under [subparagraph 205(c)(ii) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), administrative code C43](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-205.html).

The PGWP category allows students to apply for an open work permit to gain valuable Canadian work experience if they

*   have graduated from an eligible Canadian [designated learning institution](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) (DLI) and
*   meet the specific requirements of the category

Receipt of application – 180-day time period
--------------------------------------------

The PGWP application must be received within 180 days of the foreign national obtaining written confirmation from the DLI indicating that they have met the requirements for completing their program of study.

Calculation of the 180 days begins on the earliest of either

*   the day the final marks for the program were issued
*   the day the applicant receives formal written notification that they have completed the program 
    *   The applicant should provide proof of the date they receive the official letter of completion or copy of their transcript.

*   the day the credential (diploma, certificate, etc.) for the program was issued

Place of application
--------------------

Foreign nationals may apply for a work permit in the post-graduation category

*   in Canada, if eligible (section R199) or
*   outside Canada (section R197)

**Important:** As of June 21, 2024, foreign nationals seeking a PGWP are no longer able to apply at a port of entry (POE) as a result of [new ministerial instructions](https://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2024/2024-06-22/html/notice-avis-eng.html).

### In Canada – study permit is valid

Study permits are generally issued for 90 days longer than the expected end date of the program. However, international students are provided 180 days from the completion of their studies to apply for a PGWP.

Applicants may apply for a PGWP from **within Canada if their study permit is still valid (not expired)** or if they meet one of the other requirements of [section R199](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-199.html) at the time they submit their application.

Applicants who apply for their PGWP **while their study permit remains valid** may be authorized to work without a permit pending a decision on the work permit application under paragraph R186(w). They are not authorized to work under R186(w) if their study permit is invalid or expired when they apply for their PGWP.

**Important:** If a foreign national has submitted an application to extend their study permit and they have authorization to study under section R189, section R199 does not apply to them, and they must wait until their new study permit is received in order to be eligible under R199.

### In Canada – study permit becomes invalid or is expired

Applicants whose study permit becomes invalid or expires before they apply for a PGWP may not be eligible to apply from in Canada because they would no longer meet the requirements of section R199, even if they have maintained their temporary resident status as a visitor. In these cases, the applicant must submit their PGWP application under section R197 for processing outside Canada.

However, if the applicant is eligible for restoration under section R182, they can restore their status as a temporary resident with authorization to study by applying for a study permit. They must meet all the regular study permit requirements, including that they hold a valid letter of acceptance from the DLI where they intend to study. They may also concurrently submit a PGWP application.

If the study permit is approved and issued, then the requirement of section R199 for the submission of the work permit application in Canada would be met. Therefore, the concurrent work permit application can be processed.

### Port of entry

In accordance with the [ministerial instructions](https://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p1/2024/2024-06-22/html/notice-avis-eng.html) that took effect on June 21, 2024, border services officers are not to process PGWP applications made on entry to Canada.

**Note:** An application made outside Canada that has received preliminary approval for which the applicant has been issued a letter of introduction is to be finalized and the work permit is to be issued at the port of entry.

### Outside Canada

An applicant who no longer has the ability to apply for a work permit in Canada in accordance with section R199, may submit their application electronically for processing outside of Canada under section R197. They may remain in Canada as long as they maintain their temporary resident status, or they may leave Canada and wait for a decision on their PGWP application. Applicants must meet the eligibility criteria for the category and apply within the 180 days from the completion of their studies.

**Note:** An applicant may electronically submit an application under section R197 (outside Canada) while they physically remain in Canada. They must maintain their status as a visitor until they receive the actual work permit. However, they are **not eligible** to work, in accordance with [paragraph R186(w)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-186.html), while waiting for a decision on their PGWP application.

In addition, after receiving provisional approval, they will have to leave and re-enter Canada to be examined and issued any provisionally approved work permit. As per measures implemented by the CBSA on December 24, 2024, letter of introduction holders will be unable to receive their work permit at a port of entry if they are attempting re-entry from the US or St. Pierre and Miquelon, unless they meet one of the stated exemptions. For more information on who may apply for a work permit at a port of entry, see: [Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) and International Mobility Program (IMP): Persons who may apply at a port of entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/persons-who-may-apply-port-entry.html)

    *   [leave from studies](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s13)
    *   [final academic session](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s14)
    *   [special measures between January 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s6)
    *   [special measures between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s7)

*   have received written confirmation of completion of their program of study from the eligible DLI
*   have met the additional language and field of study requirements, if applicable (see: [Additional eligibility criteria for PGWP applications](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s4))

### Additional eligibility criteria for PGWP applications

#### Language requirement

For PGWP applications submitted on or after November 1, 2024, applicants must

*   demonstrate they meet the minimum language level in the Canadian Language Benchmarks (CLB) in English or the Niveaux de compétence linguistique canadiens (NCLC) in French for each of the 4 language skill areas (speaking; listening; reading; writing) 
    *   A minimum of CLB **7** in English or NCLC **7** in French is required for: 
        *   all graduates of degree-granting programs of study (that is, bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree) from a PGWP-eligible DLI (**see Note below**)
        *   graduates from university programs of study that do **not** result in a degree

    *   A minimum of CLB **5** in English or NCLC **5** in French is required for: 
        *   graduates from any other college program or non-university program of study that does **not** result in a bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree

**Note**: As of March 11, 2025, non-university graduates from programs resulting in a bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree must meet the same language requirements as university graduates. Non-university graduates from degree-granting programs who apply for a PGWP **on or after November 1, 2024** and before **March 11, 2025** only need to meet a minimum of CLB **5** English or NCLC **5** in French.

Applicants are **exempt** from the language requirement in the following situations:

*   They applied for their PGWP **before** November 1, 2024
*   They graduated from a flight school
*   They are applying to extend their PGWP, **and**
    *   their initial PGWP could not be issued for the full eligible validity due to their passport validity (see: [Passport validity](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s28) for details on PGWP extension applications) **or**
    *   they are applying to change the conditions on their PGWP (for example, medical conditions for occupation-restricted work permits)

#### Field-of-study requirement

PGWP applicants must complete a program of study in an [eligible field of study](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/eligibility/field-of-study.html) if they:

*   graduated from a program that does not result in a bachelor’s, master’s or doctoral degree

Officers must consult the eligible field-of-study list to determine eligibility.

The eligible field-of-study list may be subject to change. To ensure fairness for students, their PGWP eligibility is determined based on the list of eligible fields of study **when they applied for their study permit or when they applied for their PGWP**. If the program was in an eligible field-of-study on the date they submitted the study permit application, applicants may complete that program and remain eligible for a PGWP even if that field-of-study becomes ineligible by the time they apply for a PGWP.

**Note**: A student who obtained a bachelor’s degree from a university through a pathway program between two different types of DLIs (for example, college to university) can follow the PGWP eligibility rules that are associated with acquiring a credential from a bachelor’s degree program.

PGWP applicants are **exempt** from the above field-of-study requirement in the following situations:

*   They applied for their PGWP **before** November 1, 2024
*   They graduated from a bachelor’s, master’s or doctorate degree program from a PGWP-eligible DLI
*   They graduated from a flight school
*   They applied for their study permit **before** November 1, 2024 
    *   This includes applicants who may apply for a study permit extension on or after November 1, 2024 to complete their studies, regardless of the field-of-study they had on the initial study permit.

**Note**: PGWP applicants who may have held a study permit prior to November 1, 2024 and submit a **new study permit** application on or after November 1, 2024, would not meet this exemption from the field-of-study requirement. 

### Ineligible applicants

Foreign nationals who studied at a DLI are **ineligible** if they

*   are submitting their application at a port of entry on arrival in Canada
*   have previously been issued a PGWP
*   completed more than 50% of the credits toward the completion of their program of study by distance learning 
    *   Various special measures related to distance learning were implemented between[March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s7).

*   completed only 
    *   a course or program of study on English or French as a second language
    *   general interest or self-improvement courses

*   have received funding or a scholarship from Global Affairs Canada that specifies the requirement for recipients to return to their home country after graduation
*   completed a program of study delivered by a non-Canadian institution located in Canada, regardless of their length of stay in Canada
*   completed a course or program of study at a DLI that is not PGWP-eligible 
    *   This includes programs delivered by a private career college, or on behalf of a PGWP-eligible institution through a[curriculum licensing agreement](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s5.1), unless the applicant meets the criteria for one of the exceptions below.

#### Curriculum licensing agreements

Curriculum licensing agreements allow students to graduate from a program that was delivered by a private career college on behalf of a public PGWP-eligible institution. These programs are **not PGWP-eligible** unless a student meets the criteria for one of the exceptions below:

**Exception 1**: Curriculum licensing agreements **between provinces and territories** (cross-jurisdictional)

*   Students who began a program of study at a private college being delivered on behalf of a public college in another province/territory on or before January 31, 2023, may be eligible for a PGWP. They must also meet all other PGWP eligibility criteria. 
    *   For example, a student enrolled in a cross-jurisdictional curriculum program on September 1, 2022, and finalized their program in May 2024. They would remain eligible for a PGWP because they were enrolled before January 31, 2023.

*   Students who have completed their cross-jurisdictional program and submitted an application for a PGWP on or before January 31, 2023, continue to be eligible if they also meet all other PGWP eligibility criteria. 
    *   For example, a student completed their program under a cross-jurisdictional curriculum program on October 31, 2022. They must have applied for their PGWP on or before January 31, 2023, to be eligible.

*   Students beginning these **cross-jurisdictional programs on or after February 1, 2023,** are **not eligible** for a PGWP.

**Exception 2**: Curriculum licensing agreements **in the same province or territory**

*   Students who began a program of study at a private college being delivered on behalf of a public college in the same province before May 15, 2024, may be eligible for a PGWP. They must also meet all other program PGWP eligibility criteria. 
    *   For example, a student who began a program of study under a curriculum licensing agreement program on May 14, 2024, may be eligible for a PGWP. 

**No exceptions**: Students beginning curriculum licensing agreement **programs on or after May 15, 2024**, will **not be eligible** for a PGWP.

There are now distinct DLI numbers for private career college programs delivered as part of a curriculum licensing agreement. The DLI and program should be reviewed to ensure the applicant is eligible for a PGWP.

Officers have the discretion to request additional documentation, if needed, in support of the applicant’s attendance in an eligible DLI or program of study.

### Special measures – Part-time status between January 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020

Students in Canada or outside Canada may have been required to put their studies on hold or become part-time students due to course cancellations that were the result of public health measures at DLIs. For the winter, spring and summer semesters of 2020 only (that is, between January 1, 2020, and August 31, 2020), if a student’s status changed from full-time to part-time because of changes in course delivery at a DLI, their eligibility for a PGWP will not be impacted.

### Special measures for study outside Canada between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2024

Special measures were put in place to facilitate students who were unable to study in Canada as a result of travel restrictions. Details are provided for the different requirements for these special measures between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2024.

#### Special measures between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2022

The requirement that applicants must complete the [majority of their studies in person while in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s15) is waived for any foreign national who

*   was in one of the following situations 
    *   had a valid study permit
    *   was approved for a study permit
    *   had submitted a study permit application **before** beginning their program online that eventually received a positive final decision

*   between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2022, they 
    *   were enrolled in a PGWP-eligible program
    *   started a PGWP-eligible program

*   applied for a work permit in the post-graduation category within 180 days of completing their PGWP-eligible program

#### Special measures between September 1, 2022, and August 31, 2024

On September 1, 2022, as there were no further travel restrictions, the special measures were changed. The “reduced facilitation measures” were in effect between September 1, 2022, and August 31, 2024, for international students who began PGWP-eligible programs between those dates.

To be eligible for the facilitation measures in the validity period, these students must meet **one** of the following requirements:

*   have a valid study permit or
*   have been approved for a study permit and have yet to arrive in Canada between the dates or
*   have submitted a study permit application before beginning their program that was approved before August 31, 2024

All students who started a program of study between September 1, 2022, and August 31, 2024, **are required to complete at least 50% of their program (or programs) of study in Canada**.

*   For the above group of students, time spent studying outside Canada will be counted toward the overall length of the PGWP only if it constitutes less than 50% of the program.

**Note:** A study permit application must be received before any time spent studying at a DLI while physically outside Canada counts toward the length of the PGWP. For clarity, any studies an applicant started before IRCC received a study permit application do not count.

 For example, eligible programs must be a minimum of 8 months. If the applicant completes only 7 months of studies after their study permit application is received, they will not be eligible for a PGWP.

Students who graduate while **outside** Canada and meet the eligibility requirements of the reduced facilitation measures described above **do not need to hold or to have held a valid study permit** within 180 days of receiving confirmation of program completion when applying for a PGWP. To be eligible to apply, these graduates

*   must either have a study permit or have held a study permit and
*   must apply within 180 days of receiving written notification from their DLI that they completed their program

**Up to 100% of their program can be completed online while outside Canada.**

**Note:** The “hold authority to study in the 180 days from receiving confirmation of program completion when applying for a PGWP” requirement is waived for students who graduate while outside Canada but met the eligibility requirements of these special measures. However, they must have applied for a study permit **before completing their studies** and received approval for the study permit before applying for a PGWP.

Documentary evidence
--------------------

Officers should be satisfied that they have sufficient evidence of all of the following to decide if eligibility criteria are met:

*   evidence that the program or programs of study have been completed, in the form of one of the following documents: 
    *   an official letter from the applicant’s DLI confirming that they have met the requirements to complete their program of study
    *   an official transcript issued by their DLI
    *   a transcript copy from their DLI’s website
    *   an education credential from the DLI

*   evidence that the applicant was enrolled in full-time studies in a program of study that was 8 months or longer, which will generally be their list of classes and marks in the form of 
    *   an official transcript issued by their DLI
    *   a transcript copy from their DLI’s website

*   if applicable, evidence that the applicant has completed a program in an [eligible field of study](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/eligibility/field-of-study.html)
    *   For details on who must complete a program in an eligible field of study, see: [Field-of-study requirement](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s4.2)

**Note**: The field-of-study requirement is based on Classification of Instructional Programs (CIP) system codes. To demonstrate meeting the field of study requirement, a CIP from the PGWP-eligible field-of-study list should be provided on official documentation by the DLI, such as the letter of completion. To meet this requirement, the CIP should be on the PGWP-eligible list at the time of the study permit application or PGWP application. However, if it is missing from official documentation by the DLI, applicants are encouraged to include the eligible CIP code along with an explanation of how they meet the CIP code relating to their field of study.

*   for PGWP applications submitted on or after November 1, 2024 (unless [exempt](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s4)), evidence demonstrating that they meet the minimum language level in the CLB in English or the NCLC in French for each of the 4 language skill areas (reading, writing, listening and speaking), as per the [eligibility requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s4)
    *   See [Proof of language proficiency](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s8.1) for further details.

The transcript or the letter of completion of studies can be used on its own to assess the requirements referred to above if the applicant provides all the information needed. For example, if the letter of completion indicates the program details—that the applicant attended full-time (except in their final term) and completed the program—then a copy of the transcript would not be required. However, if the evidence provided is insufficient to satisfy the officer that the eligibility criteria are met, the officer can request additional documents before making the final decision.

### Proof of language proficiency

Language test results provided as proof of language proficiency must be:

*   from an IRCC-approved test
*   less than **2 years old** on the date of PGWP application

#### If the applicant is unable to complete all sections of the language test due to disability

If an applicant is unable to be tested in all 4 skill areas, IRCC exempts applicants from providing evaluation results in up to 3 of the 4 language skill areas. Instead, IRCC will accept averaged scores using the [language calculator tool](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/immigrate/skilled/language-tool.asp) that is used for permanent resident purposes. The language evaluation results, both those that could be completed and the averaged scores, must be considered in the same manner as any other language evaluation results.

### Applicants studying in Quebec

Foreign nationals who study in Quebec are not required to have a valid Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ) when submitting a PGWP application. As the PGWP is an open work permit and is exempt from a labour market impact assessment, a valid CAQ or study permit is not required when the PGWP is issued.

If foreign nationals are applying for a PGWP and their study permit has expired, they can apply to restore their status as a student without a CAQ and apply for the PGWP at the same time; the CAQ is not required for the PGWP.

Application assessment
----------------------

### Full-time studies

Officers can review the transcripts to confirm that the applicant was enrolled in full-time studies in their program. The term “full-time” is defined by the individual DLI.

There are specific situations where an applicant may not be attending full-time classes but will still be eligible for a PGWP.

**Note**: If an applicant studies part-time during **regularly scheduled breaks** (for example, regularly scheduled winter and summer breaks), this does not count toward a PGWP eligibility’s full-time requirement.

### Part-time status for final academic session

Applicants must maintain full-time student status during each academic session of the program or programs of study they complete, and this status is required for their PGWP application. However, if the applicant meets all the eligibility requirements, with the exception of full-time status during their final academic session (that is, they have part-time status only in their final academic session), they are still considered eligible for the PGWP.

A student’s final academic session is to be interpreted as any semester in which a student could complete their program of study. In cases where a student has part-time status in their final semester, but fails a course and needs to retake it to graduate, both semesters may be considered as a final academic session.

Students should be able to demonstrate that throughout their studies they have made reasonable progress toward the completion of their courses to remain compliant with their study permit conditions (for more information, see: [Study permits: Assessing study permit conditions)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/assessing-conditions.html#s12).

### Applicants impacted by a DLI strike or unforeseen closure

Applicants who are impacted by a strike or unforeseen closure affecting a DLI in Canada are considered to be studying full-time during the strike or closure period. The period of time in which the students are not attending class due to a school strike does not impact their eligibility under the PGWP. Applicants impacted by a school strike or closure must meet all other eligibility requirements under the PGWP and must have remained compliant with the conditions of their study permit, as outlined in [Assessing study permit conditions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/assessing-conditions.html#s12).

An example of an unforeseen closure could be that the DLI is affected by a wildfire or flood.

### Leave from studies

If the applicant remained in Canada while they were a student and took leave from their studies during their program, the officer must determine if the applicant was compliant with the conditions of their study permit, as outlined in [Assessing study permit conditions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/assessing-conditions.html). If the applicant took a [period of leave](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/assessing-conditions.html#leave) that was authorized by their DLI at any time during their studies, they must include, with their application, documentation that proves the leave was authorized by the DLI. Officers may request additional documents to complete their assessment. To comply with [subsection R220.1(1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-220.1.html), students must

*   be enrolled at a [DLI](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html)
*   remain enrolled at a DLI
*   be actively pursuing their course or program of study

If the officer determines that the applicant actively pursued studies during their leave, the applicant may still be eligible for the PGWP category.

If the officer determines that the applicant did not meet the conditions of their study permit, they may be prohibited from being issued a work permit for 6 months from the date they stopped their unauthorized study or work, as per [subparagraph R200(3)(e)(i)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html).

### Majority of studies in person in Canada

Foreign nationals are required to complete the majority of their studies in person while in Canada with authority to study. Officers should be confirming that the applicant was physically in Canada and attending classes in person full-time.

#### Distance or online learning

Distance learning can be considered online learning, but applicants who complete a program of study exclusively by distance learning (outside or within Canada) are not eligible for a PGWP.

**Important:**Special measures were in place from March 1, 2020, to August 31, 2022, that allowed up to 100% of studies to be completed by distance learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Additional special measures were in place from September 1, 2022, to August 31, 2024. For more information: [Special measures for study outside Canada between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s7).

Officers should use the following guidelines to assess an applicant’s PGWP eligibility when the applicant has taken courses by distance learning in Canada at an eligible DLI:

*   If more than 50% of the program of study’s total courses are completed by distance learning, the program may reasonably be considered a distance-learning program, and the applicant is ineligible for a PGWP.
*   If less than 50% of the program of study’s total courses are completed by distance learning, a PGWP may be issued. The validity should be based on the length of the program, as confirmed by the eligible DLI, including credits earned from both in-class and distance-learning courses.

**Note:** If the distance-learning courses are completed from outside Canada, they must be excluded from the time that counts toward the length of the PGWP.

#### Distance learning while in Canada

If a student’s courses were moved online due to the pandemic, the time the student spent studying online in Canada until August 31, 2024, still counts toward the length of the PGWP. However, students are highly recommended to attend in-class options when offered.

The temporary policy change for in Canada students studying online ended on August 31, 2024. For more information: [Special measures for study outside Canada between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s7).

### Completed eligible program at an eligible DLI

Officers should confirm that the applicant provided evidence that the program or programs of study taken met all of the criteria below. They were

*   a majority (50% or more) in person in Canada
*   a minimum of 8 months in duration
*   at an eligible DLI, such as 
    *   a public post-secondary institution, such as 
        *   a college
        *   a trade or technical school
        *   a university

    *   a Canadian, private institution authorized by provincial or territorial statute to confer degrees, and the applicant was enrolled in a program of study leading to a degree, such as 
        *   an associate degree
        *   a bachelor’s degree
        *   a master’s degree
        *   a doctoral degree

**Note:** Not all programs of study offered by a private institution may be eligible.

*   In Quebec only, the following institutions are eligible: 
    *   private post-secondary institutions that operate under the same rules and regulations as public institutions in Quebec
    *   private or public secondary or post-secondary institutions in Quebec offering qualifying programs of 900 hours or longer leading to 
        *   a diploma of vocational studies (DVS)
        *   an attestation of vocational specialization (AVS)

    *   CEGEPs (College of General and Professional Teaching)

See the [DLI list](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/prepare/designated-learning-institutions-list.html) to verify the school’s eligibility. Beginning December 7, 2023, if a DLI’s program eligibility for the post-graduation work permit changes, the program will remain listed for a period of 12 months and will indicate that only applicants who completed the program before a specified date are eligible for the post-graduation work permit.

### Program stacking

Program stacking is when students complete more than one PGWP-eligible program from a PGWP-eligible DLI. To qualify for program stacking in relation to PGWP duration, **both** PGWP-eligible programs must

*   be a minimum of 8 months in duration
*   be completed at a PGWP-eligible DLI 

The second program must be completed within 2 years of the completion of the first program.

**Exemption note:**For [distance learning facilitation measures](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s7) to apply until August 31,2024, eligible students must

*   have graduated from 2 eligible programs of study, where **both** programs were either in progress in March 2020 or were started between March 2020 and August 31, 2022
*   have completed 100% of both programs outside Canada **and**
*   be able to combine the length of their programs of study when they apply for a PGWP in the future

Students who started their second program on or after September 1, 2022, are not eligible for the special measures even if their first program was in progress in March 2020 or began between March 2020 and August 31, 2022.

**Note:** For students taking [vocational programs in Quebec](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s23), in order to qualify for program stacking in relation to PGWP duration, the diploma of vocational studies (DVS) program must be at least 900 hours in duration to be eligible, but an attestation of vocational specialization (AVS) program can be less than 900 hours in duration when submitted in combination with the DVS.

#### Program stacking for study permits obtained on or after November 1, 2024

If a student completes multiple programs, officers should assess each program separately against the applicable [field-of-study requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s4.2) to determine whether each program is PGWP-eligible and qualifies for program stacking.

**Example 1**: Completing 2 PGWP-eligible programs

On or after November 1, 2024, if a student completes 2 consecutive programs that are PGWP-eligible within 2 years of completion of the first program, then when they apply for a PGWP, the duration of the PGWP could be based on the duration of both programs.

**Example 2**: Completing a first program that is not PGWP-eligible and a second one that is PGWP-eligible

On or after November 1, 2024, if a student completes 2 consecutive programs where the first is not PGWP-eligible, they would not benefit from program stacking when the duration of the PGWP is determined. The duration of the PGWP would be based only on the duration of the PGWP-eligible program.

**Example 3**: Completing a first PGWP-eligible program and a second one that is not PGWP-eligible

On or after November 1, 2024, if a student completes 2 consecutive programs where the first is PGWP-eligible, and the second is not, they would not benefit from program stacking when the duration of the PGWP is determined. The duration of the PGWP would be based on the duration of the PGWP-eligible program, and the applicant would have to apply for a PGWP within 180 days of receiving confirmation that they have completed the PGWP-eligible program.

### Transfers between educational institutions

In cases where a student has transferred between [eligible DLIs](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s16), and taken PGWP-eligible programs at each, the combined length of study must be at least 8 months to qualify for a PGWP.

In cases where a student graduated from an eligible DLI after having transferred from an ineligible institution, only time spent at the eligible DLI counts to qualify for a PGWP. They must have spent at least 8 months at the eligible institution while taking a PGWP-eligible program.

**Note:**As of November 8, 2024, [section R220.1(1)(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-220.1.html) requires that study permit holders be enrolled at the DLI named on their permit and, as per section[R217.1](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-217.1.html), study permit holders in Canada whose permit names a DLI must apply for a new study permit if they wish to change DLIs. If the officer determines that a PGWP applicant did not meet the conditions of their study permit, they may be prohibited from being issued a work permit for 6 months from the date they stopped their unauthorized study or work, as per[subparagraph R200(3)(e)(i)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html).

For further information please see [Study permits: Designated learning institutions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/designated-learning-institutions.html).

**Example 1: Transferring from a foreign institution**

A student attends a foreign post-secondary institution and transfers to an accredited provincial or territorial post-secondary institution in Canada to complete their studies. In this scenario, if the qualifying educational credential were issued from an institution outside Canada, the student would not qualify for a PGWP. However, if the student received their educational credential from an eligible Canadian DLI, only the time they studied in Canada would factor into their eligibility for a PGWP.

**Example 2: Transferring from an ineligible institution**

A student attends their first year at a private post-secondary institution in Canada that is not eligible for the PGWP but then transfers to an eligible DLI. In this scenario, if the student completed their program of study at the eligible DLI, they may be eligible for a PGWP but only for the length of time they studied at the eligible DLI.

**Example 3: Transferring between eligible DLIs**

A student completes a program of study at an eligible DLI and transfers the credits earned to another eligible DLI (or transfers over the credits earned from a previous program at the same eligible DLI). A student who has changed DLIs will need to apply for a new study permit. The student may submit a letter of acceptance indicating that the credits earned in the first program have been accepted toward completing the subsequent program. The officer should consider all credits from both programs that contribute toward completing the subsequent program in determining PGWP eligibility and length. A PGWP is issued based on the completed duration of the program.

### Programs with an overseas component

If a student completes a program of study in Canada that has an overseas component, they are eligible for the PGWP, as long as they earn a Canadian educational credential from an eligible DLI, in addition to meeting all other eligibility requirements. However, the length of the PGWP is based on the length of time they studied in Canada in a PGWP-eligible program. Officers may request this additional evidence to confirm that the studies have taken place in Canada.

### DLIs that lose their designation

Applicants whose DLI loses its designation status before the completion of their program may still be eligible for a PGWP as long as they began their studies before the DLI lost its designation and they continue to meet all other program requirements and have continued to meet the conditions of their study permit (for example, be enrolled and actively pursuing studies). See [Study permits: Designated learning institutions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/designated-learning-institutions.html#s16) for further guidance on when a DLI loses its designation.

### Flight school graduates

To obtain a PGWP, flight school graduates must submit clear evidence that they meet the basic requirements for a permit and have done either of the following:

*   They have completed a flight training course at a DLI training centre and obtained a Canadian commercial pilot’s licence.
*   They have obtained or are in the process of obtaining an instructor’s rating and have received an offer of employment as a flight instructor from a DLI flight training centre in Canada.

Graduates of vocational and professional training programs in Quebec
--------------------------------------------------------------------

**Note:** The following procedures apply only to graduates of Quebec institutions with either

*   a diploma of vocational studies (DVS)
*   an attestation of vocational specialization (AVS)

See the [guidelines for determining the length of the post-graduation work permit (PGWP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s27) for the validity periods of PGWPs issued to graduates of Quebec vocational programs.

In Quebec, vocational and professional training programs can be delivered at the secondary **or** post-secondary level. The provisions of the Canada–Quebec [Memorandum of Understanding to facilitate the entry of certain temporary foreign workers](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/agreements/federal-provincial-territorial/quebec/memorandum-understanding-facilitate-entry-certain-temporary-foreign-workers-quebec.html) outline when international students are eligible for a PGWP. To be eligible for a PGWP, the student must graduate from a recognized secondary institution in Quebec with one of the following diplomas:

*   DVS
*   AVS

The diploma must be issued by the [Ministère de l’Éducation et de l’Enseignement supérieur (MEES)](http://www.education.gouv.qc.ca/en/home/) (Department of Education and Higher Education).

### Procedures

**Note:** All of the general eligibility criteria, conditions of the work permit and processing procedures for the PGWP program apply in conjunction with the conditions below.

#### Eligible applicants

Applicants who have graduated from Quebec vocational institutions with a DVS or an AVS must fulfill all of the following criteria:

*   They are 18 years of age or older at the time of application.
*   They have completed a full-time vocational or professional training program at an eligible institution in Quebec.
*   They have been in a program of study that was a **minimum of 900 hours** (equivalent to 8 months) in duration.
*   They have submitted an official letter from the institution outlining the duration of the program of study (in hours or months) to facilitate the processing and issuance of the PGWP and to confirm the duration of the work authorization.
*   They include one of the following in the work permit application: 
    *   the credential
    *   an official attestation of program completion
    *   an official transcript from a Quebec school board or private institution recognized by the MEES in support of the work permit application.

#### Eligible institutions

Officers should verify Quebec public and private secondary schools through [Inforoute: Vocational and technical training in Quebec](http://www.inforoutefpt.org/default.aspx?langue=en).

**Note:** This website is operated by the MEES and Compétences Québec. It can be used to validate the following:

*   schools
*   programs
*   length in hours
*   resulting credential

Eligible applicants who have changed institutions during their training program must have a combined total of at least 900 hours (equivalent to 8 months) of courses at eligible institutions located in Quebec for it to be considered a PGWP-eligible program.

Final decision
--------------

### Approval

The work permit will be issued under the authority of subparagraph R205(c)(ii), administrative code C43.

In the Global Case Management System (GCMS) under the Application screen, officers should enter or confirm the information below in the specified fields.

| Field | Selection or input |
| --- | --- |
| Case type | 56 – Post-Graduation Work Permit |
| Province of destination | Unknown |
| City of destination | Unknown |
| Exemption code | C43 |
| NOC | 99999 |
| Intended occupation | Open |
| Duration | Validity should be determined based on the instructions below. |
| Processing fees | * work permit processing fee * open work permit holder fee See [Fee schedule](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/schedule.html) for amounts. |
| Biometrics | * biometric fee (if applicable) |

### Determining the PGWP validity

A work permit in the post-graduation category may be issued for a minimum of 8 months up to a maximum of 3 years.

When determining the length of a PGWP, officers may consider the duration of the program of study in Canada and confirm it with[supporting documents](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s8). Regularly scheduled breaks (for example, scheduled winter and summer breaks) should be included in the time that counts toward the total validity period. Passport validity must be considered as well when determining the validity period of a work permit (see below).

### Passport validity

The validity period may not go beyond the applicant’s passport validity date. If the applicant’s passport expires before the validity period allowed based on the length of the applicant’s eligible program(s), the officer should note this reason in the User remarks field and in the Notes tab in the GCMS.

If this notation exists in the User remarks field or in the Notes tab, the applicant may apply for a work permit extension upon the renewal of their passport to receive the full validity of their PGWP.

PGWPs can be extended**only**when the length of the permit could not be provided when the application was approved, due to the expiry date of the applicant’s passport.

### Program length

| Length of the program(s) including Quebec vocational programs (diploma of college studies [DCS] or attestation of collegial studies [ACS]) | Length of Quebec vocational programs with a diploma of vocational studies (DVS) or attestation of vocational specialization (AVS) | Maximum validity period |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The length of the program of study is at least 8 months, but less than 2 years. | The length of the vocational program of study is at least 900 hours, but less than 1,800 hours. | **The length of the work permit should coincide with the length of the program**, as confirmed by the eligible designated learning institution (DLI) in the [written confirmation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s8) of program completion (such as an official letter of completion or transcript). Regularly scheduled breaks (for example, regularly scheduled winter and summer breaks) should not be subtracted from the length of the PGWP. **Note:**For graduates with a DVS or AVS, a prorated calculation may be performed to determine the work permit length. Each additional 112 hours of an authorized program of study provides the applicant with an additional 1 month of work permit validity. **Officers should round up to the next full month**. **Note:****For applications received on or after February 15, 2024:**Officers may issue a 3-year PGWP to individuals who graduated from a degree-granting master’s level program of a duration of less than 2 years if that program is delivered by a PGWP-eligible DLI in Canada. Certificate and diploma programs at the graduate level are excluded from this measure. |
| The program of study is 2 years or longer. | The vocational program of study is 1,800 hours or longer. | If the length of the program is confirmed by the eligible DLI in the written confirmation of program completion (such as the official letter or transcript), the **length of the work permit should be 3 years**. Regularly scheduled breaks (for example, regularly scheduled winter and summer breaks) should not be subtracted from the length of the PGWP. |
| The student completed more than one program from an eligible DLI within 2 years. **Note:** Each program of study must meet all the eligibility requirements of the PGWP program and be at least 8 months in duration. | The student completed more than one DVS or a DVS and an AVS from an eligible DLI within 2 years. The DVS program must be at least 900 hours in duration. The AVS program can be less than 900 hours in duration if submitted in combination with a DVS. | The length of the work permit is dependent on the eligibility of one or both programs. See [Program stacking](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s17) for details. If the combined length of the eligible programs is 2 years or longer (or 1,800 hours or longer for a combination of a DVS with an AVS in Quebec), the work permit may be valid for up to 3 years provided that the DVS program in Quebec is at least 900 hours in duration. |

### Accelerated studies

If the applicant completed their studies in less time than the normal length of the program (that is, they have accelerated their studies), the PGWP should be assessed on the length of the program, not the length of studies.

For example, if the student is enrolled in a program of study that normally consists of 3 semesters within a 1-year duration, but the student completes the requirements of the program of study within 2 semesters, that is, within 8 months, they may be eligible for a PGWP that is valid up to 1 year (or up to 3 years, if the student completed a degree-granting master’s level program).

**Important:**If the officer notes that the duration of studies was shorter than the duration of the program, as indicated in the letter confirming the completion of the program of study, and the program was not completed in an accelerated form, the PGWP may be issued according to the duration of studies. For example, if the applicant took classes for a period of 12 months, not in an accelerated form, but their classes were part of a 2-year program, the PGWP may be issued for 12 months, according to the duration of their studies.

Officers may request additional information to determine whether the program was completed in an accelerated form.

### Determining the validity period in light of distance or online learning

If less than 50% of the program of study’s total courses are completed by distance learning the validity period should be based on the length of the program, as confirmed by the eligible DLI, including credits earned from both in-class and distance-learning courses.

If the distance-learning courses are completed while the applicant is outside Canada, those courses must be excluded from the time that counts toward the length of the PGWP, unless the student is eligible under the special measures related to distance-learning (see: [Special measures for study outside Canada between March 1, 2020, and August 31, 2024](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s7)).

For further guidance regarding distance or online learning, see: [Majority of studies in person in Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html#s15)

### Refusals

When officers are not satisfied that the specific eligibility factors for this administrative code are met, they need to clearly document their reasons in the refusal note.

A decision is reasonable when the reviewing court is able to trace the decision maker’s rationale without encountering fatal flaws in the overarching logic and is satisfied that there is a line of analysis within the given reasons that could lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the decision maker’s conclusion.

The officer needs to engage with the documentary evidence that was provided by the applicant. Simply stating, “I have reviewed the submissions, and I am not satisfied that section R205 is met”, is not sufficient for another reasonable person to understand the logic of the decision without reviewing all of the evidence again.

In order to reduce the possibility of litigation on the refusal, officers should follow the steps in[Decision making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html)when finalizing their refusal notes.

The officer should ensure that case notes in the GCMS are complete and accurate. The officer should have the following components in their decision note:

*   summary of facts or evidence 
    *   outline the circumstances of the application and the requirements to be met
    *   include a brief summary of evidence provided

*   analysis 
    *   outline the process followed in coming to or making the decision
    *   take into account any representations made by interested persons (or counsel) and make note of the nature and content of these representations

*   conclusion 
    *   detail the reasons for the refusal

The grounds in the refusal letter should reflect what the officer has stated in their notes.

Work permits shall be issued if all of the requirements stated in[section R200](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html)are met. Therefore, refusal grounds should be linked to one of those requirements. Below is an example of the requirements:

**R200(1)(c)(ii) –**The applicant has not met the eligibility requirements of the International Mobility Program work permit category. Officers need to explain clearly what eligibility requirements were not met.

**Example 1**

The applicant graduated with a diploma from a college program that does not fall under one of the eligible fields of study and they applied for their initial study permit after November 1, 2024. The applicant does not meet the applicable field-of-study requirement that meets the criteria for work designated as necessary by the Minister under R205(c)(ii). Therefore, the PGWP application should be refused under subparagraph R200(1)(c)(ii), since their work is not described in section R205.

**Example 2**

The applicant submitted their PGWP application after November 1, 2024. They have not provided language test results from an IRCC-approved test, nor have they provided a reasonable alternative to a standardized language proficiency assessment, that demonstrates that they meet the minimum language proficiency requirements of the work designated as necessary by the Minister under R205(c)(ii). Therefore, the PGWP application should be refused under subparagraph R200(1)(c)(ii), since their work is not described in section R205.

PGWP applicants have been reminded in the [guides](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/apply.html#guide) and in client-facing web pages that they must submit [proof of language proficiency](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/apply.html#language). Applicants have been instructed of how to upload more than one document into a file and to upload proof of language proficiency under “Client Information.”
