Foreign freelance horse jockeys [R205(a) – C11] – Unique work situations – International Mobility Program (IMP)
===============================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

A work permit is required for all foreign freelance horse jockeys. However, those intending to work in the western provinces or Ontario may be exempt from the labour market impact assessment (LMIA) requirement pursuant to [paragraph 205(a) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-205.html), as their entry to Canada may create spin-off economic benefits in the industry.

Horse jockeys intending to work in any other province or territory require an LMIA and a work permit.

*   a licence or a letter confirming eligibility for licensing from one of the provincial horse-racing authorities that act as regulatory bodies for 
    *   British Columbia
    *   Alberta
    *   Saskatchewan
    *   Manitoba

*   an offer of employment from the first employer or horse owner (not the racetrack) making the initial offer. The first employer or horse owner must be located in one of the four western provinces.
*   proof of their experience as a horse jockey.

### Application assessment

Refer to the general instructions for [Business owners seeking only temporary residence–[R205(a)–C11]–International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/entrepreneurs-self-employed-seeking-only-temp-residence-r205-c11.html).

### Final decision

#### Approval

In the Global Case Management System (GCMS), under the Application screen, officers should enter the following information in the specified fields:

| Field | Selection or input |
| --- | --- |
| Case type | 52 |
| Province of destination | Unknown |
| City of destination | Unknown |
| Exemption code | C11 (auto-populated on match with offer) |
| NOC | 53200 (NOC 5251 for applications received before November 16, 2022) (auto-populated on match with offer) |
| Intended occupation | Horse Jockey (auto-populated on match with offer) |
| LMIA/LMIA-exempt # | “A” number from the offer of employment submitted in the Employer Portal |
| Employer | Auto-populated on match with offer |
| Duration | From the date of approval to November 30 of the approval year. This covers the horse racing season and allows for additional time for related pre- and post-season training activities. |
| **User remark (mandatory)** | Authorized to work as a horse-racing jockey for any horse-racing employer in the provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba. |

#### Refusal

If an officer is not satisfied that all the requirements of section R200, including the assessment under paragraph R205(a), are met, they must record their reasons in a case note, outlining the rationale underlying the decision as well as the facts and elements that were considered.

Refusal reasons should clearly indicate which criteria or what requirements of section R200 were not met and explain how the conclusion was reached. For assistance, officers can follow the steps in[Decision-making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html).

For example, if the applicant does not have sufficient funds to support themselves, the officer can indicate that paragraph R200(1)(b) is not met, as they are not satisfied that the applicant would be able to support themselves during their stay and pay for their departure from Canada given that a work permit does not guarantee employment in Canada during the period of authorized stay. Therefore, they are not satisfied that the applicant will leave Canada at the end of their authorized stay.
