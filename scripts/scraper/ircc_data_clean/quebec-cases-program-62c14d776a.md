Quebec investors: Issuance of open work permits to candidates who have received a Quebec notice of intent to select – [R204(c) – T10] – International Mobility Program (IMP)
============================================================================================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

For work permit applications made under the labour market impact assessment (LMIA) exemption code T10, “officer” refers to employees of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) **only**.

Applications made under this LMIA exemption code cannot be made on entry; therefore, T10 instructions **do not** apply to officers employed by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA).

However, with respect to the family member application(s) made under LMIA exemption C41/C46, those instructions apply to both officers employed by IRCC and the CBSA, as applications can be made before entry (IRCC), on entry (CBSA) and after entry (IRCC).

The instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with the following:

*   [Open work permit – General processing and issuance](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html)
*   [Conditions and validity period on work permits](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/eligibility-admissibility-conditions-including-validity-period.html)

[Paragraph 204(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-204.html) authorizes the issuance of work permits under section R200 to foreign nationals if the work for which the permit is requested is subject to an agreement ratified by the minister and a province under subsection 8(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).

On January 1, 2024, a new agreement came into force between Canada, represented by the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, and Quebec, represented by the Quebec Ministre de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration (MIFI). Under the agreement, selected investor candidates who receive a Quebec notice of intent to select are eligible to apply for an open work permit under the administrative code T10.

Eligibility
-----------

To be eligible under paragraph R204(c), administrative code T10, the foreign national, must at the time of decision meet all of the following requirements:

*   have submitted an application for a work permit using an online [IRCC Secure Account](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/account.html) (referred to as MyAccount or the Authorized Paid Representative Portal)
*   plan to physically reside in Quebec
*   have included a Quebec notice of intent to select in the work permit application

Documentary evidence
--------------------

With the application for an open work permit, officers should be satisfied that they have the following documentary evidence to make an assessment:

*   a Quebec notice of intent to select issued by MIFI (the template is available internally only and in French only).

### Notice of intent to select

**Note:** This notice of intent to select will inform investor candidates that they must submit a work permit application within 6 months of the date of issuance of the notice to select.

If the work permit application is received after the **6-month** period from the date of issuance of the notice of intent to select, the work permit application will be refused.

In the event this agreement on the issuance of work permits to investor candidates is rescinded or put on pause by Canada or Quebec, the Quebec notice of intent to select must have been issued prior to the receipt of the notice to pause or end this agreement. Any work permit application received with a Quebec notice of intent to select issued after this notice is received by either party will be refused, as per paragraphs 6.2, 6.6, or 8.8.1 of the agreement.

Application assessment
----------------------

Officers must be satisfied that all eligibility requirements are **met at the time of decision** on the work permit application and the applicant is not inadmissible.

If officers have any concerns as to the genuineness of the documents provided, they can undertake an assessment to ensure this material information is genuine and does not reflect a direct misrepresentation of facts to appear eligible for the permit.

Officers should note that applicants are given specific instructions on the IRCC website on how to complete the application for work permit. Applicant instructions can be found at [Open work permit for Quebec investors](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/special-instructions/quebec-investor.html).

Applicants are instructed to input the following in the “Details of intended work in Canada” section:

**Box 1:** What type of work permit are you applying for?

Select “Open Work Permit.”

**Box 4:** “Job title”

Enter “T10 Quebec Investors” in the “Job title” box.

**Important:** Officers should be aware that the “Job title” box on the application form maps to the “Intended occupation” field in the Global Case Management System (GCMS).

### Mandatory association to the principal foreign national

The principal foreign national application must be associated to the family member applications; additionally, the family member must be associated with the principal foreign national in the Client screen in GCMS.

This is required to ensure the ability to retrieve data on principal applicants and their family members for reporting purposes.

Final decision
--------------

### Approval

The work permit will be issued under the authority of paragraph R204(c).

In GCMS under the “Application” screen, officers should enter the information below in the specified fields:

| Field | Selection or input |
| --- | --- |
| Case type | 20 |
| Province of destination | **Quebec** **Important:** For applications of family members of the principal applicant, the province destination should be “Quebec,” and not left as “unknown”. **Note:** Destination city should be left as “unknown”. |
| Exemption code | T10 |
| Employer | Open |
| Intended occupation | Open |
| NOC | 99999 |
| Duration | The open work permit may be issued for 36 months or until the expiry of the passport, whichever comes first. |
| Conditions | Officers should ensure that the instructions provided in [Work permit issuance in GCMS: Occupation or location restricted](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/open.html#issuance-restricted) are followed. For example, the work permit of family members of the principal applicant must be restricted by the province (**not by the city**). This condition should be added: **Not authorized to work at any other location.** |
| **User remarks (Mandatory)** | The following remark must be added to all open work permits: **Authorized to work anywhere in the province of Quebec as per applicable labour laws.** |
| Fees | $155 work permit processing fee $100 open work permit holder fee |
| Biometrics | Work permit applicants are required to provide biometric information and pay the biometric fee ($85). The regular biometric exemptions apply (for example, age or 1 in 10). |

### Refusals

If an officer has determined that the applicant does not meet the eligibility requirements, the work permit application should be refused. They should record their reasons for decision as per the instructions in: [Decision-making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html).

**Example:**

“Under subparagraph 204(c) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, a labour market impact assessment-exempt open work permit may be issued under administrative code T10 – Quebec Investors Program if the applicant received a valid Quebec notice of intent to select.

Based on the information you have submitted, you have not demonstrated that you meet the eligibility criteria for this type of work permit. As such, your work permit application is refused.”

Renewals
--------

Investor candidates have access to only one work permit renewal for a maximum duration of 24 months under the agreement.

An investor candidate may renew their work permit by submitting a new work permit application if they meet all of the following conditions:

*   The candidate has a valid Quebec Selection Certificate (CSQ) issued under the Quebec Investor Program.
*   The candidate has not yet submitted an application for permanent residence or has submitted an application for permanent residence but has not yet received a completeness check.

The applicant and accompanying family members must reside in Quebec at the time of the renewal.

All work permit renewal applications without proof of a CSQ will be refused.

Family members
--------------

Family members (spouses, common-law partners and dependent children) are eligible to apply for an open work permit under [subparagraph R205(c)(ii) [Administrative Code C41/C46]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c41-c46.html), restricted to the province of Quebec. Family members are not required to provide proof that the principal applicant is employed **at the time of decision** on the family member application.

**The family member’s work permit must always be restricted to the province of Quebec.**

The open work permit for the family member should have a validity that matches the principal applicant’s or that of the passport or travel document of the family member, whichever is earlier.

### Study permits

The instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with [Temporary residents: Students](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits.html).

### Temporary resident visa (TRV) or electronic travel authorization (eTA)

*   Preschool-age dependants need to apply for either a temporary resident visa (TRV) or an electronic travel authorization (eTA). At the port of entry, the preschool-age dependant should be authorized to enter for the same duration as the principal applicant’s open work permit or until the expiry of the passport or travel document of the family member, whichever is earlier.

### Visitor records

*   When a visitor record is issued for study permit–exempt family members, a note should be added in the “User Remarks”: “Authorized to attend primary and secondary school”.
*   The instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with the [visitor record](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/visitor-record.html).
