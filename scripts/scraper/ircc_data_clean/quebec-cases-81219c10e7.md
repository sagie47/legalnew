Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP)
---------------------------------------

Canada–Quebec Accord
--------------------

Under the terms of article 22 of the [Canada–Quebec Accord](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/agreements/federal-provincial-territorial/quebec/canada-quebec-accord-relating-immigration-temporary-admission-aliens.html), Quebec’s consent is required to grant entry to temporary foreign workers who are subject to labour market impact assessment (LMIA) requirements.

Foreign workers whose destination is Quebec must obtain the consent from the ministère de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’intégration (MIFI) to enter Quebec and take temporary employment. This consent is granted through the issuance of a Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ).

According to the [Quebec Immigration Regulation](https://www.legisquebec.gouv.qc.ca/en/document/cr/I-0.2.1,%20r.%203), the Minister’s consent to enter Quebec, granted through the issuance of a CAQ, is not required if any of the following conditions apply:

*   The employment is continuous in duration for a maximum of 30 days.
*   The employment is **not** paid.
*   The foreign national’s employment does not require an assessment of the impact that the employment offer has on the Quebec labour market (term that designates an LMIA in the Quebec Immigration Regulation).

Requirement of the attestation of issuance of a Quebec Acceptance Certificate (CAQ)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [CAQ](https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/work-quebec/temporary-workers/temporary-foreign-worker-program/authorizations/application-temporary-selection) is issued by the MIFI only for foreign nationals whose employment requires an LMIA.

As of December 11, 2023, the MIFI is no longer issuing a paper confirmation letter of the CAQ to temporary foreign workers. Instead, the MIFI is now issuing an online attestation of issuance of a CAQ. Certain applicants (such as applicants under the agriculture stream and in-home caregivers) will receive the attestation by mail until the online option is implemented.

Officers should continue to accept the old version of the CAQ issued before December 11, 2023. On August 2, 2018, the MIFI introduced a new CAQ that no longer has validity dates. The expiry date was replaced by a duration period, in months. The CAQ becomes effective at the time the work permit is issued. This modification was made to ensure the work permit can be issued for the full duration of the employment specified on the LMIA and CAQ.

Per section 105 of the Quebec Immigration Regulation, the MIFI Minister’s consent for a foreign national’s stay, given under section 5 of this Regulation, is valid for the duration provided for in the positive assessment of the impact on Quebec’s labour market, up to a maximum of 36 months.

The start of the period provided for in the Quebec Immigration Regulation takes effect on the date the work permit is issued, under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) (SC, 2001, C. 27).

**Note:** To extend a CAQ, a job offer must be reconfirmed by the [MIFI](https://www.quebec.ca/en/immigration/work-quebec/temporary-workers/temporary-foreign-worker-program/renewing-authorizations).

International Mobility Program (IMP)
------------------------------------

Foreign nationals who are coming to work in Quebec under the IMP do **not** require a CAQ.
