Business visitors – CPAFTA [R186(a)] – Authorization to work without a work permit – International Mobility Program
===================================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

In these instructions “officers” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency.

The instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with:

*   [Business visitors [R186(a)]: Authorization to work without a work permit – International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/business.html)
*   [Public list of Employers who have been non-compliant](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/employers-non-compliant.html)

Officers should initially assess Panamanian citizens, nationals and permanent residents against the general [business visitor instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/business.html) for [R186(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) found in [the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) and related Program Delivery Instructions (PDIs). In cases where their activities are not covered by the general provisions, officers should refer to the business visitor provisions provided in [Chapter 13 of the Canada-Panama Free Trade Agreement (CPAFTA)](http://international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/panama/fta-ale/13.aspx?lang=eng) to determine eligibility under R186(a).

Eligibility
-----------

To be eligible as a business visitor under the CPAFTA, a foreign national must:

*   be a citizen or permanent resident of Panama;
*   be engaged in permissible business activities as described in [Appendix 13.04-A](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/panama/fta-ale/13.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Appendix%C2%A013.04%2DA%3A%20Business%20Visitors) of the CPAFTA;
*   be engaged in permissible activities that are international in scope;
*   not have intent to enter the Canadian labour market: 
    *   the primary source of remuneration for the business activity remains outside Canada
    *   the principal place of business of the foreign national remains outside Canada

*   be compliant with existing immigration and admissibility requirements for temporary entry; and
*   request entry as a business visitor at the port of entry (POE).

Business visitors must apply at a POE in the same manner as persons covered by other paragraphs of [R186](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-186.html). An application cannot be made prior to arriving in Canada.

Border services officers at the Primary Inspection Line may make the determination that a foreign national meets the requirements for temporary entry as a business visitor, **except persons applying for entry under the after-sales or after-lease service provision**, who should be referred to Immigration Secondary due to the complexity of the application and for reasons of client service and program consistency.

Permissible business activities
-------------------------------

The permissible business activities are generally of a commercial nature that reflect the components of a business cycle. Typical examples of business activities include, but are not limited to, consultation, negotiation, discussion, research, participation in educational, professional or business conventions or meetings and soliciting business.

The following are the permissible business activities under [Appendix 13.04-A](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/panama/fta-ale/13.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Appendix%C2%A013.04%2DA%3A%20Business%20Visitors) of the CPAFTA:

The term “commercial transaction” found in some provisions in [Appendix 13.04-A](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/panama/fta-ale/13.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Appendix%C2%A013.04%2DA%3A%20Business%20Visitors) of CPAFTA may be described as any act within the confines of the law that is performed expressly to derive a profit. Commercial transactions refer to discussions and negotiations in respect to the sale, purchase, marketing, distribution, advertisement, procurement, transmission, transportation or packaging of goods or services.

### Research and design

*   Technical, scientific and statistical researchers conducting independent research or research for an [enterprise](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#e1) located in the territory of the other Party.

### General service

*   Professionals engaging in a business activity at a professional level in a profession set out in [Appendix 13.04-D](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/panama/fta-ale/13.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Appendix%C2%A013.04%2DD%3A%20Persons%20Engaged%20in%20Specialty%20Occupations) of the CPAFTA. 
    *   In order to determine whether the professional meet the conditions of R186(a) an officer should consider how the professional is being renumerated. An individual who is to be paid in Canada would be considered to be joining the labour market and could not be authorized to enter Canada as a business visitor, whereas, professionals whose primary source of remuneration for the business activity remains outside Canada may qualify.

*   Translators or interpreters performing services as employees of an enterprise located in the territory of the other Party.

### After-sales or after-lease service

*   Installers, repair and maintenance personnel, and supervisors, possessing specialized knowledge essential to a seller's contractual obligation, performing services or training workers to perform services, pursuant to a warranty or other service contract incidental to the sale or lease of commercial or industrial equipment or machinery, including computer software, purchased or leased from an enterprise located outside the territory of the Party into which temporary entry is sought, during the life of the warranty or service agreement.

### Specific eligibility requirements for after-sales or after-lease service

The following requirements apply to business visitors seeking entry under the after-sales or after-lease service provisions of CPAFTA:

*   citizen or permanent resident of Panama, who is employed by an enterprise established in Panama;
*   purpose of entry is to install, repair, service, or supervise these functions, or train workers to perform services;
*   work is pursuant to an original sales or lease contract and any warranty or service agreement incidental (connected) to the sale or lease of equipment or machinery (including computer software);
*   equipment or machinery (including computer software) is commercial or industrial (not for household or personal use);
*   equipment or machinery or computer software was manufactured and purchased outside Canada;
*   work is carried out during the validity of any warranty or service agreement or any extensions of same;
*   work requires specialized knowledge (which excludes hands-on building and construction work); and
*   compliance with existing immigration requirements for temporary entry.

**Note:** Persons granted entry to train or to supervise training may also train or supervise workers who are doing the hands-on building and construction work. This may require demonstrating certain procedures. The demonstration must not result in the completion of an [installation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#i1) or servicing task, or of part of such task, or in the productive operation of the equipment or machinery.

The CPAFTA**does not**relieve after-sales or after-lease service personnel, or any other business person, from the obligation to comply with municipal, regional, provincial/territorial, or other federal requirements, where applicable.

### Work that does not meet the eligibility requirements of after-sales or after-lease service

Persons whose activities or services in Canada would constitute hands-on building and construction work may **not** enter under [R186(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) and CPAFTA as after-sales or after-lease service.

Generally the entry of foreign tradespersons in the building and construction industry is subject to an assessment of the availability of domestic labour (an LMIA). As part of the LMIA process, Service Canada will consult with organized labour prior to making a determination.

For personnel performing the installation or servicing, entry should not be granted when performing hands-on building and construction work. The performance of these activities is not permitted, regardless of wording in sales, warranty or service agreements supporting they be completed.

**Building and construction work:**includes installing, maintaining, and repairing utility services, any part of the fabric of any building or structure, or machinery, equipment, or structures within a building.

Building and construction work includes activities normally performed by (but not limited to):

*   labourers;
*   millwrights;
*   heat and frost insulators;
*   bricklayers;
*   carpenters and joiners;
*   electrical workers;
*   operating engineers (includes heavy equipment operators);
*   elevator constructors;
*   sheet metal workers;
*   teamsters;
*   boilermakers;
*   residential, commercial, or industrial painters (including the application of all service coatings no matter how applied);
*   bridge, structural, and ornamental ironworkers;
*   plumbers and pipefitters;
*   roofers;
*   plasterers and cement masons.

Building and construction work includes work involving:

*   assembly lines;
*   conveyor belts and systems;
*   overhead cranes;
*   heating, cooling, and ventilation or exhaust systems;
*   elevators and escalators;
*   boilers and turbines; and
*   dismantling or demolition of commercial or industrial equipment or machinery whether on-site or in-plant.

Documentary evidence
--------------------

A business visitor under the CPAFTA must provide the following documentation:

*   proof of Panamanian citizenship or permanent residency;
*   documentation to support the purpose for entry (must be a business activity listed in [Appendix 13.04-A](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/panama/fta-ale/13.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Appendix%C2%A013.04%2DA%3A%20Business%20Visitors) of the CPAFTA); and
*   evidence that the business activity is international in scope and that the they are not attempting to enter the Canadian labour market. 
    *   the primary source of remuneration is outside Canada, and
    *   the person’s place of business remains outside Canada and the profits of the business are accumulated primarily outside Canada.

Oral declaration as to the principal place of business and the actual place of accrual of profits can be used as documentary evidence. If further proof is requested, a letter from the employer or the representing organization is sufficient. Prior approval procedures, labour certification tests, or other similar procedures cannot be required. Every effort should be made to avoid the requirement of a visa.

In general, an individual who is to be paid in Canada would be considered to be joining the labour market and could not be authorized to enter Canada as a business visitor. The payment of expenses incidental to the trip is allowed, as is an honorarium.

### Documentary evidence for after-sales service:

Business visitors applying under the after-sales service provision of CPAFTA should be referred for a secondary examination when seeking entry, as per [Appendix 13.04-A](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/panama/fta-ale/13.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Appendix%C2%A013.04%2DA%3A%20Business%20Visitors) of the agreement.

The following documentation is required:

*   proof of Panamanian citizenship or permanent residency; and
*   copies of the original sales agreement, and warranty or service agreement, including extensions, which clearly support the purpose of entry.

The warranty or service contract must be incidental to, or connected to the sale of commercial or industrial equipment or machinery, including computer software.

The warranty or service agreement does not need to have the same date as the sales agreement. Particularly with third party service as it may take a number of months after the sale before the company installing or servicing the machinery is identified and sub-contracted.

The initial warranty or service agreement may be extended provided that the sales agreement, or initial warranty or service agreement contained a provision allowing for the extension. The after- sales service, therefore, continues to be contracted as part of the sale of the equipment or machinery, or computer software.

### Third party service

If [third party service](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#t3) occurs, there must be clear wording in the sales agreement that specifies a third party will perform the installation, warranty, or service work. Unless such wording exists, there is no evidence that the third party service is incidental to the sale. However, the firm need not be named in the agreement, as it may take some time for the firm to be identified. When a third party is not named in the sales agreement, business visitors may be expected to provide a letter from the seller of the equipment that identifies them as the third party referenced in the original sales agreement.

When a seller located in Panama contracts the after-sales servicing to a third party, it must be established in Panama.

### Lack of Documentation

Every effort should be made to allow documentation to be provided (e.g., by fax, email or verbal explanation) from the company in Canada or the business visitor’s employer in Panama.

The requirement of documentation has been imposed in order to clearly establish that the proposed activity is incidental or connected to the sale of the equipment or machinery or computer software.

A verbal statement that the business of the applicant is being carried on outside Canada can be acceptable. Alternative indications (business cards, business papers, advertising pamphlets, etc.) may be helpful.

Final decision
--------------

### Visitor record

A business visitor’s stay in Canada will usually be short-term (6 months or less).

It is recommended that border services officers consider issuing a [visitor record](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/visitor-record.html) to a business visitor engaged in ‘after-sales or after-lease service’ work for a period of longer than 6 months and indicate in the “Remarks” section why a longer period of time is being granted.

These visits may take place over a period of weeks or months. In these circumstances, border services officers should consider issuing a visitor record to reduce potential referrals on future entries.

Applications for extension of status should be determined based on whether the foreign national remains eligible.
