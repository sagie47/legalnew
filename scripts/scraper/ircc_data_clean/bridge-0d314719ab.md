Unique work situations: Bridge and tunnel authorities employees working in Canada - LMIA exemption C20 – International Mobility Program
=======================================================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

International bridge and tunnel authorities may employ United States (U.S.) citizens and permanent residents to perform a range of functions on the Canadian side of the border. The owner or operator of an international bridge or tunnel, as defined in [section 2](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-17.05/page-1.html#h-2) of the International Bridges and Tunnels Act, is [exempt from the employer compliance regime](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/compliance-exempt-employers.html).[Footnote i](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/compliance-exempt-employers/bridge.html#fni)

A work permit is required but is exempt from a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) under reciprocal employment general guidelines [[R205(b)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-205.html)] (exemption code C20).

Work permit issuance in the Global Case Management System (GCMS): interim instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GCMS will not require an LMIA exemption number (A#) to be entered. Although the employer is exempt from paying the [employer compliance fee](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/fees/immigration/work-permit-r196-r299-1.html), the system will still expect the fee to be paid. The processing officers must manually enter **fee exemption code “EC1.”**

Because the work permit type “Other” was selected on the work permit application, GCMS automatically defaults to case type 20. The officers must manually change the case type to the new case type 60 under the “Application” screen.

Based on the employment contract or other documentation submitted with the work permit application, officers should enter the following under the “Application” screen:

*   Province of Destination: Address of physical job location (if there is more than one location, officers should enter the primary location in the “Province of Destination” field and all secondary locations in the “Remarks” field)
*   City of Destination: Address of physical job location (if there is more than one location, officers should enter the primary location in the “City of Destination” field and all secondary locations in the “Remarks” field)
*   Exemption Code: C20
*   Intended Occupation: Job title
*   Salary: As indicated on the letter of employment or employment contract issued by the employer
*   Employer: Name of the owner of the international bridge or tunnel

Applicants destined to Quebec
-----------------------------

Foreign nationals destined to work in Quebec under [sections R204 to 208](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-204.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (LMIA exemptions) do not require a Quebec Acceptance Certificate.

Footnote i
As an example, the Peace Bridge Authority manages the international crossing between Fort Erie and Buffalo and has approximately 50 U.S. employees performing toll and administrative functions on the Canadian side of the border. Other international bridge or tunnel authorities may also employ U.S. citizens and permanent residents to perform a range of functions in Canada.
