Temporary resident: Individuals named in an immigration warrant
===============================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

When an inadmissible individual fails to comply with a Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) officer's request to appear at an enforcement office for reasons such as receipt of a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) determination or to enforce their removal from Canada at a POE, the officer may issue a warrant for the arrest and detention of the individual. After a full investigation, if the individual cannot be located, a Canada-wide warrant for their arrest is entered on the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC) system, which is accessible to all law enforcement agencies and ultimately gives them the authority to arrest on the CBSA's behalf. This process is in place to ensure that individuals with active warrants for removal are apprehended as soon as possible and removed from Canada to maintain the integrity of the immigration program.

When an individual named in a warrant submits an application, CIC must inform the CBSA.
