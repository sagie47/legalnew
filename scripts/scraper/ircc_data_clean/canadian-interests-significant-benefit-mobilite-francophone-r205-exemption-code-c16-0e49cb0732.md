Francophone mobility – [R205(c) - C16] – Canadian interests – International Mobility Program
============================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

In these instructions, the term “officers” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Service Agency.

The instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with

*   [Employer-specific work permits — General processing](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html)

**As of June 15, 2023,** the minister has designated the category of work by foreign nationals with moderate French-speaking proficiency equivalent to a Canadian Language Benchmarks (CLB) / Niveaux de compétence linguistique canadiens (NCLC) level 5 in all occupations located outside of Quebec, except primary agriculture occupations under Training, Education, Experience and Responsibilities (TEER) 4 and 5, as necessary for public policy reasons related to the competitiveness of Canada’s academic institutions or economy under [subparagraph 205(c)(ii) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-205.html).

The purpose of the work designation is to promote the French language in Francophone minority communities outside Quebec. The administrative code for this work in the International Mobility Program (IMP) is C16.

From June 1, 2016, to June 14, 2023, applications under this code were assessed under [paragraph R205(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-205.html) with the rationale that a significant cultural or social benefit was created by the work of certain French-speaking foreign nationals destined for a province or territory outside Quebec who

*   were assessed at the ability to meet a CLB / NCLC level 7 or higher
*   qualified under TEER category 0, 1, 2 or 3 of the National Occupational Classification (NOC)

Instructions for applicants are found in [Francophone Mobility work permit: How to apply](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/special-instructions/francophone-mobility.html).

**For applications submitted on or after June 15, 2023**

 Officers can use their discretion to be satisfied that sufficient evidence has been provided that the applicant has a moderate French-language proficiency equivalent to a CLB or NCLC[level 5 or higher](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/language-requirements/test-equivalency-charts.html).

A foreign national’s speaking and listening ability in French is a key factor of this work permit category. If, on assessment, the officer is not satisfied that the applicant has sufficient language skills, the officer may request

*   further evidence of language ability, for example, a satisfactory results of a TEF or TCF or 
*   that the applicant complete an oral assessment

**For applications submitted before June 15, 2023**

Officers can use their discretion to be satisfied that sufficient evidence has been provided that the applicant’s habitual language of daily use is French.

The fact that a foreign national’s habitual language of daily use is French is a key factor of this work permit category. If, on assessment, the officer is not satisfied that the applicant has sufficient language skills, the officer may request

*   results from a TEF or TCF that shows a CLB or NCLC[level 7 or higher](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/language-requirements/test-equivalency-charts.html)

 or
*   an assessment by the examining officer at an interview 

### Review the offer of employment

Officers should assess

*   the offer of employment to ensure it meets the requirements of the specific situation under the administrative code
*   the genuineness of the job offer 

| Field | Considerations |
| --- | --- |
| LMIA Exemption Code | C16 Ensure that the exemption code matches the description in “Requirements Exemptions Met.” |
| Requirements Exemptions Met | Does the information in this field indicate that the foreign national has a language evaluation that meets requirements? |
| NOC and Job Title | Is the occupation reasonable for the employer to need? For example: Is this the sixth supervisor to be hired even though there is a total of only 10 employees? |
| Wages | Are the wages equal to the minimum wage of the province or territory? Are they reasonable for the position? Can the employer afford to pay the wages based on their reported income? |
| Duties and Job Requirements | Do the activities that the foreign national will be performing align with the exemption category and the occupation stated? Are there specific requirements that align with the exemption (for example, specific educational level, employment experience qualifications, etc.)? Has the applicant provided sufficient evidence that they meet the employment requirements? |

### Program integrity

Officers may consider the following questions:

*   Has this employer recently hired many employees from the same region for the same position?
*   Does the contact information for the employer match the name of the company?

Extension
---------

For applications submitted **on or after June 15, 2023**, the determination of whether the applicant has a **moderate** French-language proficiency at the CLB or NCLC[level 5 or higher](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/language-requirements/test-equivalency-charts.html) was made at the time of initial application; therefore, a proof-of-language test result is not required upon renewal unless the processing officer has concerns.

For applications submitted **before June 15, 2023**, the determination of whether the applicant’s **habitual**language of daily use is French was made at the time of initial application; therefore, a proof-of-language test result is not required upon renewal unless the processing officer has concerns.

All other requirements must be met by the applicant renewing a work permit under this administrative code.

| --- | --- |
| Case type | 52 – Employer-specific LMIA-exempt application |

| City of destination | The city of destination entered by the applicant should match the address of employment in the IMP offer of employment (under the**Employment Details – LMIA-exempt**tab). **Note:**If there is more than 1 location, officers should enter the primary location in the “City of destination” field and the secondary location in the “Remarks” field. |
| Exemption code | C16 This code is auto-populated from the IMP offer of employment. This code should only be changed in specific circumstances. For further instructions see[Changes between the offer of employment and the work permit application](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html#t9). |
