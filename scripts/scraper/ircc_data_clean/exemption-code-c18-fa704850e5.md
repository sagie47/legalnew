Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP) – [R204(c) – C18] – Agreements or arrangements – International Mobility Program (IMP)
========================================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

In these instructions, "officer" refers to an employee of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). These instructions do not apply to the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), as applicants are not eligible to apply for this program at the port of entry.

The Atlantic Immigration Class, referred to as the Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP), was established through [regulations on January 1, 2022](https://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2021/2021-12-22/html/sor-dors242-eng.html). The goal of this program is to attract and retain skilled immigrants and international graduates in Atlantic Canada through an employer-driven approach.

The Atlantic Immigration Pilot Program (AIPP) agreements expired on December 31, 2021, with the expiration of the pilot bilateral agreements.

**Transition provisions**: IRCC included transition provisions in the new bilateral agreements, starting January 1, 2022, which provide the following authority:

1.   to accept and process**complete** work permit applications under the AIPP received up to [midnight UTC](https://time.is/UTC) on March 5, 2022 
    *   Processing may continue beyond this date so long as the **complete** application was received by March 5, 2022.

2.   to accept work permit renewal applications under the AIPP for applicants who have submitted their complete application for permanent residence on or before March 5, 2022, and are still waiting for a decision 
    *   These work permit applications will be assessed against the AIPP work permit requirements.

Categories under the AIPP include

*   Atlantic High-Skilled Program
*   Atlantic Intermediate-Skilled Program
*   Atlantic International Graduate Program

Facilitating entry for these workers under the International Mobility Program (IMP) supports[paragraph 3(1)(e) of the _Immigration and Refugee Protection Act_ (IRPA)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-3.html)by encouraging the settlement and retention of workers in the Atlantic region.

| Field | Considerations |
| --- | --- |
| Requirements exemptions met | This field must indicate that there is an approved endorsement from an Atlantic province. Information in this field outlines how the job position or the foreign national meets the LMIA exemption requirements. This should not be cut and pasted from IRCC’s website. |
| Duties | This field should show that the duties align with the lead statement and main duties, as stated in the NOC code. These are the activities that the foreign national will be performing. See the note under [Qualifying work experience](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/special-initiatives-pilot-project/exemption-code-c18.html#s11). |
| Provincial or federal certification, licensing or registration | Documentary evidence should be provided with the application; however, some occupations may require the foreign national to write an exam after they enter Canada (for example, for a licence from a regulated body or a first aid certificate). |

Qualifying language results
---------------------------

Applicants under the AIP **must** demonstrate, in the Canadian Language Benchmarks for English **or** the Niveaux de compétence linguistique canadiens for French, **in each of the 4** language skill areas based on an IRCC-approved [language test](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/language-testing.html).

See the [language requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/language-requirements.html) section for evidence of language proficiency.

Qualifying educational credential
---------------------------------

### Applicants other than those applying as a recent graduate

Applicants other than those applying as recent graduates must demonstrate they have 1 of the following educational [credentials](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/glossary.asp#educational_credential).

For applications received between January 1, 2022, and November 15, 2022, **or** applications received on or after November 16, 2022, where the provincial endorsement included was issued under NOC 2016, applicants must demonstrate a minimum of either

*   a Canadian 1-year post-secondary credential, or the foreign equivalent with an educational credential assessment (ECA), where the job offer is NOC type 0 or NOC skill level A or B, **or**
*   a Canadian high school certificate, or the foreign equivalent with an ECA, where the job offer is NOC skill level B or C.

For applications received on or after November 16, 2022, and the provincial endorsement letter was issued on or after November 16, 2022, under NOC 2021, applicants must demonstrate a minimum of either

*   a Canadian 1-year post-secondary credential, or the foreign equivalent with an ECA, where the job offer is in TEER category 0, 1, 2 or 3, **or**

**Note:** Foreign credentials must be supported by an [ECA report from an agency approved by IRCC](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/education-assessed.html) if the program of study was completed outside of Canada. The assessment must be less than 5 years old, unless the candidate has already submitted a complete permanent resident application under the AIP with a valid ECA at the time of permanent residence submission.

**Important:** Equivalency assessments will include an assessment by the designated organization of the authenticity of the applicant’s completed foreign educational credentials. This assessment provided by the designated organization **is not** conclusive evidence of the authenticity of the foreign educational credentials.

If an officer has concerns about the authenticity of an applicant’s foreign educational credentials, they must follow the [procedural fairness](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/procedural-fairness.html) guidelines.

### Recent graduate from an institute in an endorsing Atlantic province

To meet requirements as a recent graduate under the AIP as of January 1, 2022, applicants must have obtained an eligible educational credential.

To be eligible, the credential must be

*   a degree
*   a diploma
*   a certificate
*   a trade or apprenticeship credential

It must also have been obtained

*   as a full-time student
*   after completion of a minimum 2-year program
*   from a [recognized post-secondary institution in 1 of the 4 Atlantic provinces](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/post-secondary-institutions.html) (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, or Newfoundland and Labrador)
*   within the 24 months before the date of submission of the work permit application

An educational credential **is not** eligible if the credential was obtained in a study or training program where

*   the study of English or French as a second language was at least half of the program
*   distance learning was at least half of the program
*   a scholarship or fellowship stipulated that the recipient return to their home country to apply the knowledge and skills gained

Qualifying work experience
--------------------------

Applicants under the AIP must have 1 year of experience within the 5 years preceding the date of work permit application.

For applications received between January 1, 2022, and November 15, 2022, **or** applications received on or after November 16, 2022, where the provincial endorsement included was issued under **NOC 2016**, the work experience must

*   be in occupations that are listed in Skill Type 0 Management Occupations or Skill Level A, B or C of the NOC matrix, exclusive of restricted occupations;
*   include the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation in the NOC **and**
*   include a substantial number of the main duties of the occupation as per the NOC

For applications received on or after November 16, 2022, and the provincial endorsement letter was issued after November 16, 2022, under **NOC 2021**, the work experience must

*   be in occupations that are listed in TEER 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 of the NOC matrix, exclusive of restricted occupations
*   include the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation in the NOC **and**
*   include a substantial number of the main duties of the occupation as per the NOC

Foreign nationals who meet the [recent graduate](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/special-initiatives-pilot-project/exemption-code-c18.html#s10) requirements do not need to meet the qualifying work experience requirement.

### Offer of employment

Under the Atlantic Immigration Class regulations [[R87.3(6)(d)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-87.3.html)], the occupation in the offer of employment may be for a higher skill level than the qualifying work experience. When assessing if the applicant can perform the work sought as per [paragraph R200(3)(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html), officers should consider all of the following:

*   that the employer is satisfied the applicant can perform the higher-level occupation
*   that the employer has worked with a settlement service provider organization to develop a settlement plan for the employee and their family
*   that the province has assessed the offer and determined that it is genuine as per the agreement
*   that during their work experience at the lower-level occupation, the applicant may have performed some of the duties of the higher-level occupation

**Important**: The offer of employment cannot be for a lower-level occupation than the qualifying work experience. For example, an applicant who has worked as a fish plant manager cannot be approved if they accept an offer as a seafood worker.

For example, where an application is received between January 1, 2022, and November 15, 2022, **or** an application is received on or after November 16, 2022, where the provincial endorsement included was issued under NOC 2016:

*   An applicant has worked as a fish and seafood plant worker under NOC 9463, a NOC level C occupation.
*   The offer of employment under the AIP is for a fish processing supervisor under NOC 9213, a NOC level B occupation.
*   The worker may have sufficient years of experience, so they could progress easily to the higher occupation, or they may have acted in that occupation, so they have sufficient experience to satisfy an officer that they can perform the work sought.

For example, where an application is received on or after November 16, 2022, and the provincial endorsement letter was issued after November 16, 2022, under **NOC 2021**:

*   An applicant has worked as a fish and seafood plant worker under NOC 94142, a TEER 4 occupation.
*   The offer of employment under the AIP is for a fish processing supervisor under NOC 92012, a TEER 2 occupation.
*   The worker may have sufficient years of experience, so they could progress easily to the higher occupation, or they may have acted in that occupation, so they have sufficient experience to satisfy an officer that they can perform the work sought.

**Note:** The only exception to approving a lower-level occupation than in the work experience is where the experience was acquired while working as either

*   a registered nurse (NOC 31301[on or after November 16,2022] or NOC 3012[on or before November 15,2022]), **or**
*   a licensed practical nurse (NOC 32101[after November 16,2022] or NOC 3233[on or before November 15,2022]), and they are being offered employment as a nurse’s aide, orderly or patient services associate (NOC 33102 [on or after November 16,2022] or NOC 3413 [on or before November 15,2022]) or as a home support worker (NOC 44101 [on or after November 16,2022] or NOC 4412 [on or before November 15,2022])

Atlantic Immigration Pilot Programs (AIPP) requirements
-------------------------------------------------------

### AIPP official language proficiency

**Note:** The test results must be less than 2 years old on the date of the work permit application.

See the [language requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/language-requirements.html) section for evidence of language proficiency.

### AIPP education requirement

#### Atlantic International Graduate Program

The applicant must demonstrate that they **meet all** of the following minimum education and residence requirements:

*   that, as a full-time student, they have obtained a degree, diploma, certificate, or trade or apprenticeship credential following the completion of a post-secondary education program of at least 2 years from a recognized [publicly funded institution](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/atlantic-immigration/post-secondary-institutions.html) in 1 of the 4 Atlantic provinces (New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia or Newfoundland and Labrador)
*   that they resided in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador or Prince Edward Island for at least 16 months (cumulative) within the 24-month period before their credential was granted
*   that they maintained valid temporary resident status throughout their stay in Canada and had authorization for any work, study or training they engaged in while in Canada

#### Eligible educational credentials

Only certain educational credentials are eligible for the Atlantic International Graduate Program. An educational credential **is not** eligible if the credentials were obtained in a study or training program where

*   the study of English or French as a second language was at least half of the program
*   distance learning was at least half of the program
*   a scholarship or fellowship stipulated that the recipient return to their home country to apply the knowledge and skills gained

**Note:** The education credential must have been obtained within 24 months of the date on the application for the C18 work permit.

#### Atlantic High-Skilled Program and Intermediate-Skilled Program

Applicants must demonstrate they have one of the following:

*   a Canadian secondary (high school) or post-secondary certificate, diploma or degree
*   a completed foreign [credential](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/glossary.asp#educational_credential) and an [ECA report from an agency approved by IRCC](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/documents/education-assessed.html)
    *   The ECA report must show that the foreign education is equal to a completed Canadian secondary (high school) diploma or post-secondary certificate, diploma or degree. The ECA report must be less than 5 years old at the time of application.

**Note:** The ECA report is conclusive evidence that an applicant’s completed foreign educational credentials are equivalent to at least a completed Canadian secondary school educational credential.

Equivalency assessments include an assessment of the authenticity of the applicant’s completed foreign educational credentials. This **is not** conclusive evidence of the authenticity of the foreign educational credentials.

If an officer has concerns about the authenticity of an applicant’s foreign educational credentials, they must communicate these concerns to the applicant and afford them an opportunity to respond to those concerns and provide additional information or documentation.

### AIPP work experience requirement

#### Atlantic International Graduate Program

Applicants do not require any work experience.

#### Atlantic High-Skilled Program and Intermediate-Skilled Program

Applicants must demonstrate that they have obtained work experience

*   for at least 1 year (1,560 hours total/30 hours per week), continuous or non-continuous, full-time or an equal amount in part-time, within the last 3 years
*   that was for paid work (volunteer work and unpaid internships do not count)
*   in an occupation with the following NOC codes: 
    *   For high-skilled program – at skill type 0 or skill levels A or B of the NOC matrix
    *   For intermediate-skilled program – at skill level C of the NOC matrix

*   where they have carried out the activities listed in the lead statement of the [NOC](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/Home/Welcome/6476b97b654a4f3491a00d176e7bda38?GoCTemplateCulture=en-CA) and a substantial number of the main duties

**Note:** Work experience acquired while working as a registered nurse or registered psychiatric nurse (NOC 3012) or a licensed practical nurse (NOC 3233) can count if the applicant has a job offer as a nurse’s aide, orderly or patient services associate (NOC 3413) or as a home support worker (NOC 4412).

For the periods of work experience claimed in the application, applicants under the Atlantic High-Skilled Program and the Intermediate-Skilled Program must demonstrate they performed **both** of the following:

*   the actions identified in the lead statement of the NOC description
*   a substantial number of the main duties, including all the essential duties, listed in the NOC description 
    *   This means the applicant performed some or all of the main duties, including all the duties that distinguish one particular occupation from any other.

Applicants do not have to be employed at the time they apply.

Work experience does not need to be continuous to qualify, and can be accumulated within the previous 3 years. When calculating the period of 12 months of required employment, it cannot include periods of unemployment, prolonged sick leave or parental leave. However, a reasonable period of vacation time will be counted towards meeting the work experience requirement (such as a 2-week period of paid vacation leave within a given 52-week period in which the applicant was engaged in qualifying work).

Any periods of self-employment will not be included when calculating the period of qualifying work experience.

Work experience acquired during a period of study is allowed, as long as the work hours did not exceed their authorization under the regulations or any applicable policies.

**Note:** In the case of work performed in Canada, the foreign national must have been both authorized to work and a temporary resident at the time.

### AIPP provincial referral letter

Applicants under the AIPP must include a referral letter, issued by an Atlantic province, with their work permit application. This letter should include the following information:

*   the date of issue of the letter
*   the applicant’s name and date of birth
*   the applicant’s citizenship
*   a designated employer’s name, address and contact information
*   an employment start date
*   the specific AIPP subprogram the applicant is applying under
*   a statement that the designated employer has submitted an endorsement application that includes a needs assessment and settlement plan for the applicant and each member of the family, signed by both the designated employer and the applicant
*   a request for IRCC to issue a 2-year employer-specific work permit, with the validity dates as indicated in the offer of employment
*   a statement that the employer urgently needs the applicant as an employee before the application for permanent residence is complete
*   a statement that the province has determined that 
    *   the job offer is consistent with the requirements of the Ministerial Instructions classes
    *   the employment is not part-time or seasonal
    *   the wages and working conditions of the employment are sufficient to attract and retain Canadian citizens and permanent residents

*   the NOC classification
*   an occupation title
*   the unique identifying number of the letter

Work permit extension
---------------------

### Permanent resident application submitted compliant with commitment

If the application for permanent residence takes more than 1 year to be processed, applicants may apply to [extend their work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/extend.html) under the AIP.

Applicants holding a work permit issued under the AIPP or AIP do not have to provide the following supporting documents:

*   a referral letter, unless there is a change of employer
*   educational credentials
*   language test results
*   proof of qualifying work experience, if applicable

**Note:** Applicants under either the AIP or AIPP are **not** eligible for a [bridging open work permit](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/provincial-nominees-permanent-resident-applicants/bridging-open-work-permits.html).

### De-designation of the employer by the province

Work permits cannot be made invalid, revoked or cancelled if an employer is de-designated by a province. However, if an employer is found to be non-compliant with [employer conditions,](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/application-consequences-where-employer-found-non-compliant-conditions.html) through an inspection, the work permit may be revoked.

Officers may refuse work permit extension applications to work for an employer who has been de-designated by the province. Foreign nationals may apply to change their work permit to work for another employer, provided that the employer is designated and that the province has issued a referral letter to support the new work permit.

Open work permits for family members
------------------------------------

Officers may issue an open work permit to family members of an AIP or AIPP applicant if that applicant has a job offer in any TEER category (for example, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 position).

*   For family members of foreign nationals authorized to work in a high-skilled occupation (TEER 0, 1, 2 or 3), see [Family members of foreign nationals authorized to work in high-skilled occupations (TEER 0, 1, 2 or 3)– [R205(c)(ii)– C41 and C46]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c41-c46.html).
*   For family members of foreign nationals authorized to work in low-skilled occupation (TEER 4 or 5), see [Family members of foreign nationals authorized to work in low-skilled occupations (TEER 4 or 5)– [R205(c)(ii)– C47 and C48]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-competitiveness-economy/c47-c48.html).
