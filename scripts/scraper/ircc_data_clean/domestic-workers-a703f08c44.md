International Mobility Program: Domestic workers of foreign representatives
===========================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

Official status and accreditation may be granted to the domestic workers of certain high-level members of a diplomatic mission, consular post or international organization. A _Household Domestic Worker Employment Agreement_(HDWEA) must be submitted by the employer to the Department of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Development(DFATD) Office of Protocol. The post must not issue a visa until the DFATD Office of Protocol has approved the contract. The domestic worker is designated as being in the employ of a foreign representative, and permission to work in Canada is granted pursuant to the [paragraph 186(_b_)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html).

Domestic workers must undergo an interview with a visa officer as well as an immigration medical examination prior to being issued a visa. For further instructions on the nature of the interview, contact the DFATD Office of Protocol.

See also the DFATD Office of Protocol’s [policy on domestic workers along with the HDWEA template](https://www.international.gc.ca/protocol-protocole/policies-politiques/DW_DP.aspx?lang=eng).
