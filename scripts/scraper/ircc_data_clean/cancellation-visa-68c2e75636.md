Temporary residents: Individual cancellation of temporary resident visas, electronic travel authorizations, work permits and study permits
==========================================================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

On [January 31, 2025](https://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2025/2025-02-12/html/sor-dors11-eng.html), new authorities regarding individual cancellation of temporary resident documents came into force.

These regulatory changes give designated officers explicit authority to cancel electronic travel authorizations (eTAs), temporary resident visas (TRVs), work permits (WPs) and study permits (SPs) on a case-by-case basis.

These instructions apply to IRCC employees only.

These instructions apply to **immigration documents only**, not to applications.

**Note:** These individual cancellation authorities are separate from changes implemented on [March 15, 2024](https://gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2024/2024-02-14/html/sor-dors11-eng.html) that automatically cancel in GCMS by operation of law TRVs, eTAs, and temporary resident permits (TRP) when a removal order is made, and SPs and WPs when a removal order becomes enforceable.
