This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

Effective immediately, most foreign nationals in Canada are no longer eligible to apply for a work permit at a port of entry.

The following work permit applications are exempt from the above restrictions and may still be accepted for processing at a port of entry:

*   **applicants who are citizens or permanent residents of the United States of America (USA)**
*   **professionals and technicians under free trade agreements (FTAs)**
    *   professionals under the FTA with the USA and Mexico (T36)
    *   professionals under the FTA with Chile (F22)
    *   contractual service suppliers or independent professionals under the FTA with South Korea (F32)
    *   professionals under the FTA with Panama (F42)
    *   professionals or technicians under the FTA with Colombia (F12)
    *   professionals or technicians under the FTA with Peru (F52)

*   **spouses or common-law partners**of applicants under the FTAs with South Korea (F32), Panama (F42) and Colombia (F12)
*   **truck drivers** who are required to depart Canada for the purpose of their employment and, prior to their departure from Canada, held a work permit or maintained status as a result of a pending application for work permit renewal (this does not include truck drivers operating solely within Canada)
*   **applicants with pre-scheduled Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) appointments**

In these instructions, “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency.

The instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with

The Minister has designated the work performed by foreign nationals who have received a reward for academic excellence as necessary for public policy reasons related to the competitiveness of Canada’s academic institutions, or economy, under [subparagraph 205(c)(ii) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-205.html).

For the purposes of the administrative code C52, IRCC defines “academic award” as an award that involves research work, including remuneration, offered by a Canadian academic institution. An academic award is granted strictly on the basis of academic excellence.

Eligibility
-----------

To be eligible for a work permit issued under administrative code C52, a foreign national must

*   be the direct recipient of the award involving work and remuneration
*   hold an official position or an affiliation or registration with a credible academic or educational institution or agency in their country of citizenship or residence
*   demonstrate academic excellence or expertise in a field related to the particular work to be undertaken
*   be offered a position by a credible Canadian academic or educational institution or agency, or a closely affiliated organization 
    *   The employer must not be a commercial enterprise.
    *   For institutions or agencies not on the [designated learning institutions list](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/designated-learning-institutions.html), see also [Scholarships for international students](https://www.international.gc.ca/world-monde/study_work_travel-etude_travail_voyage/scholarships-bourses.aspx?lang=eng).
    *   be offered a position that reflects their experience and expertise and that will have a significant role that will actively contribute to and benefit a Canadian research project

**Note:** Credibility of the employer may be assessed by examining the mandate and capacity of the institution or agency. Is its primary function to engage in research activities or advance education or policy? Does it possess the capacity (for example, resources, expertise, network) to conduct or support research activities? What is its source of funds (for example, government, commercial enterprise)? What kind of reputation does the institution or agency have?

Documentary evidence
--------------------

The following documents should be submitted with the work permit application:

*   either 
    *   an offer of employment number generated by the Employer Portal when the Canadian institution submits the offer, or
    *   the Offer of Employment to a Foreign National Exempt from a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) form [IMM 5802] **if authorized** for the Canadian institution to use by the Client Experience Branch or Immigration Program Guidance Branch to submit the form (see [Alternate submission [IMM 5802]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html#t4) for details)

*   proof of payment of the employer compliance fee
*   evidence of the award received (letter from the entity providing the award that details how it meets the award criteria) 
*   evidence of how the position offered reflects their expertise and experience and how the role that they will play on the project is suitable (for example, an undergraduate student is unlikely to lead a research project on their own)

Global Case Management System (GCMS) fields to review in the offer of employment
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

| Field | Considerations |
| --- | --- |
| LMIA Exemption Code | C52 – the employer should have selected this code Ensure that the exemption code matches the description in ‘Requirements Exemptions met’ |
| Requirements Exemptions Met | Information in this field should outline * what the academic award is * how the foreign national meets the award criteria * how the foreign national will contribute to the research project * the academic or educational institution the foreign national is affiliated with if the employer is not themselves, such an institution Please note that the information regarding how the employer and applicant meet the LMIA-exemption category requirements may be in an attachment to the offer. |
| NOC | ##### The National Occupational Classification (NOC) code should be for the occupation that matches the foreign national’s prospective duties |
| Duties | These are the activities that the foreign national will be performing. Do they align with the occupation and what is described in the [National Occupational Classification](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/)? |
| Job Requirements | Are there specific requirements that align with the exemption? For example, they must hold a specific degree or they must have specific experience. |

Awards funded by Canadian institutions
--------------------------------------

*   The award must be given based on merit and academic excellence.
*   The award must be the result of a competitive assessment and review process. 
    *   The onus is on the applicant to provide details, such as, to whom the award was open (for example, criteria for eligibility); how the applicant came to participate in the award process (for example, nomination, self-submission); and the criteria or process used to select the winner(s).

*   The award must **not** be primarily for recruitment or commercial purposes.
*   Included in this category are [Global Affairs Canada (GAC) award programs](http://www.scholarships-bourses.gc.ca/scholarships-bourses/non_can/opportunities-opportunites.aspx?lang=eng), where the recipients do not qualify for a study permit and do require a work permit.

Awards funded by foreign institutions
-------------------------------------

Academic research award recipients who are supported by their own country or institution, and are invited by Canadian institutions to conduct research activities in Canada, may also be eligible for this exemption.

Self-funded research
--------------------

In addition, certain foreign nationals seeking to carry out self-funded research may meet the [definition of a business visitor](https://ircc.canada.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=434&top=16) and thus be eligible to work without obtaining a work permit. For foreign nationals doing self-funded research to be considered business visitors, officers must be satisfied that they meet the [criteria for the business visitor category](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/business.html).

Refer to [Study permits: Off-campus work](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/campus-work.html) for guidance.
