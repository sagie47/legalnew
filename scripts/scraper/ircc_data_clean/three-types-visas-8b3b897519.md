Multiple-entry visa
-------------------

The multiple-entry visa

*   allows the holder to seek entry to Canada from any country as often as necessary during the visa’s period of validity
*   has a maximum validity date of up to 10 years or the expiry date of either the travel document or biometrics, whichever comes first
*   can still be valid if affixed in a full or complete passport or travel document (in this case, the holder must also be in possession of a newer and valid passport or travel document and must present both documents to the airline carrier in order to travel to Canada and to the border services officer in order to seek entry to Canada)

### Guidelines for issuing single or multiple-entry visas

Officers may exercise their judgement in deciding whether to issue a single- or a multiple-entry visa.

Some factors to consider:

1.   Purpose of visit 
    *   Is the applicant coming for a one-time event, such as a conference, training session or tourism, or will they be returning to Canada on a regular basis, such as to visit close family members?
    *   Are they a permit-exempt short-term student or worker? Do they require parent authorization to travel for each visit (for example, as an unaccompanied minor coming for a summer program)?
    *   Is the visit for compassionate purposes, such as to care for a family member who is critically ill or dying?

2.   Funds 
    *   Does the applicant have a stable, ongoing source of funds, such as employment, that would be sufficient to finance multiple visits to Canada?
    *   If the host (family or friend) in Canada will cover the applicant’s expenses, is proof of relationship provided, and is the host well established in Canada?
    *   Has the host also invited other people? Do they have sufficient resources to provide for all invited individuals for multiple visits? 
    *   Will the funds be provided by the applicant’s employer (such as for a one-time conference or business meeting)? Has the employer submitted a letter attesting to this fact?

3.   Medical 
    *   Has the applicant indicated any health conditions that may worsen over time? 
    *   Is the applicant coming for [medical treatment](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/medical-requirements/exam/evaluating-temporary-resident-applications-medical-treatment.html)?
    *   Has the client provided a mitigation plan, such as proof of health insurance? If so, how long is it valid for?

4.   Other factors 
    *   Has the applicant demonstrated strong ties to their home country such as employment or family obligations?
    *   Has the applicant travelled outside their home country? Have they previously travelled to Canada? If so, did they comply with the terms and conditions of their visa?
    *   Was the applicant previously refused a visa for Canada or any other country? 

### Determining the validity period

For multiple-entry visas, officers may decide to issue the visa with a validity period shorter than the maximum (10 years or the expiry of either the passport or biometrics, whichever comes first).

*   Some factors to consider: 
    *   Is there a short-term purpose for the visit, for example, a business visitor providing after-sales support as part of a warranty or sales agreement?
    *   What is the applicant’s status in their current country of residence? Will their ties to their country of residence and to Canada change over time?
    *   Are economic or political conditions in the applicant’s home country unstable?
