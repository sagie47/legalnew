International Mobility Program: Unique work situations – Airline personnel
==========================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

Provisions contained in the 1944 _Convention on International Civil Aviation_ allow for the largely unrestricted and expeditious entry of foreign air carrier personnel to the extent that such personnel is necessary to perform supervisory and technical duties connected with the operation of international air services. The agreement also embodies an element of reciprocity.

As outlined below, different requirements apply to flight crews, operational, technical and ground personnel, station managers, and foreign airline security guards:

*   **flight crews** are exempt from work permits pursuant to [R186(_s_)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html);
*   **operational, technical and ground personnel** of foreign commercial airlines require work permits, but are LMIA-exempt under [R204](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-204.html), T11;
*   **station managers** require a work permit but are exempt from an LMIA under [R205(_a_)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-205.html), C12, provided they meet the guidelines for intra-company transferees;
*   **foreign airline security guards** stationed in the airports and who are responsible for checking passengers and their luggage before they board the aircraft require a work permit, but are exempt from an LMIA pursuant to R205(_a_), (exemption code C10).
