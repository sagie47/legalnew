Engineering technologists and scientific technologists – CUKTCA – [R204(a) – F67] – Agreements or arrangements – International Mobility Program
===============================================================================================================================================

In these instructions “officers” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency.

The instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with:

*   [Employer-specific work permits – General processing – International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html)

*   [Public list of Employers who have been non-compliant](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/employers-non-compliant.html)

The [Canada-United Kingdom Trade Continuity Agreement (CUKTCA)](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/cuktca-acccru/agreement_trade_continuity-accord_continuite_commerciale.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Canada%2DUK%20Trade%20Continuity%20Agreement%20(Canada%2DUK%20TCA)%20%2D%20Agreement%20on%20Trade%20Continuity) is an international trade agreement between Canada and the United Kingdom (UK), and as such any work permit applications are assessed under [paragraph 204(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-204.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR).

CUKTCA covers 2 types of technologists: engineering and scientific. Both are subject to the same criteria as contractual service suppliers and independent professionals, with the exception of the education credentials outlined below.

CUKTCA includes a list of service sectors (set out in [Annex 10-C](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/text-texte/10-A.aspx?lang=eng#c:~:text=Annex%2010-C%20%E2%80%93%20Equivalent%20qualifications%20for%20engineering%20technologists%20and%20scientific%20technologists)) applicable to engineering and scientific technologists.

[A table](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/canada-eu/noc-equivalents.html) has been created to demonstrate equivalency between Annex 10-C and Canada’s National Occupational Classification (NOC) codes, and to highlight those occupations where Canada has made commitments to facilitate temporary entry for engineering and scientific technologists.

    *   The offer of employment provides confirmation of the pre-arranged employment
    *   the proposed employer in Canada;
    *   the profession for which entry is sought; and
    *   details of the position (title, duties, duration of employment, arrangements as to payment);

Place of application
--------------------

Foreign nationals who are exempt from the requirement for a temporary resident visa may apply for a work permit at the port of entry, as well as foreign nationals who otherwise meet the requirements of R198. For more information, see: [Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) and International Mobility Program (IMP): Persons who may apply at a port of entry](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/persons-who-may-apply-port-entry.html).

Foreign nationals may apply for a work permit from within Canada if they meet the conditions set out in [section R199](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-199.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.

Application assessment
----------------------

### Review of the offer of employment

When assessing if the work permit application meets the requirements of the CUKTCA, officers should review the offer of employment that appears under the Employment Details tab in the Global Case Management System (GCMS) for information provided by the employer (who could be the applicant) or the matching fields on the IMM 5802 form (if the employer was authorized to use it).

| Field | Considerations |
| --- | --- |
| LMIA Exemption Code | **F67**– CUKTCA – R204(a) - Engineering technologists and scientific technologists |
| Requirements Exemptions Met | Has the employer indicated how the position in Canada meets the eligibility requirements for CUKTCA? For example, what is the position that the foreign national will hold? |
| NOC and Job Title | Do the National Occupational Classification (NOC) code and job title align with their duties? |
| Duration | The maximum duration for initial work permits under the engineering or scientific technologist category is 1 year. Is the employer requesting a longer period of time than what is allowed under the CUKTCA? If yes, this may be an indicator that the foreign national may not be entering for a temporary purpose. |
| Employer | Does the offer of employment provide confirmation of the pre-arranged employment? Is the proposed employer in Canada? Does the offer of employment give accurate details of the profession for which entry is sought: * title * duties * duration of employment * arrangements as to payment? |
| Duties and Job Requirements | These are the activities that the foreign national will be performing. * Do they align with the occupation? * Do they make sense in relation to the position that is being offered? * Are there specific requirements that align with the applicant’s role? |
| Wages | **Note:** A mandatory wage assessment is not required for applicants under this category. However, for these applicants, wage remains an important indicator of knowledge, expertise and experience, and should be taken into account as an important factor in an officer’s overall assessment, although officers should not refuse an application based on the wage alone. There is no requirement that the foreign national be paid by the Canadian enterprise or in Canadian dollars. |
| Minimum Education Requirements | Are the educational requirements compatible with the stated occupation outlined in the offer of employment? The client’s education may have some bearing on whether the client meets the job requirements; however, its relative weight may be less if their work experience is sufficient. Refer to [Specific to criteria for engineering and scientific technologists](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/international-free-trade-agreements/agreement-cuktca/engineering-technologists-scientific.html#s1) for further information. |

Refer to [Employer-specific work permits – General processing – International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/eligibility/employer-specific-labout-market-impact-assessment-exemptions.html) for further guidance.

### Pre-arranged employment

In this context, the Canadian employer may be an [enterprise](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#e1) or an individual. The following are some examples of pre-arranged employment:

*   an employee-employer relationship with a Canadian enterprise; or
*   a contract between the professional and a Canadian enterprise; or
*   a contract between the professional’s UK employer and a Canadian enterprise.

**Important:** The engineering technologist and scientific technologist category does not allow self-employment in Canada (i.e., soliciting business in the Canadian labour market). However, a citizen of the UK who is self-employed outside Canada is not barred from this category, provided the services to be rendered in Canada are pre-arranged with a Canadian employer.

Final decision
--------------

### Approval

The work permit will be issued under the authority of paragraph [R204(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-204.html).

In GCMS, under the Application screen, officers should enter the information below in the specified fields.

| Field | Selection or input |
| --- | --- |
| Case type | 52 |
| Province of destination | The province of destination entered by the applicant should match the address of employment in the IMP offer of employment. This information is under the **Employment Details – LMIA-exempt** tab. If there is more than one location, officers should enter the primary location in the “Province of destination” field and the secondary location in the “User remarks” field. |
| City of destination | The city of destination entered by the applicant should match the address of employment in the IMP offer of employment. This information is under the **Employment Details – LMIA-exempt** tab. If there is more than one location, officers should enter “Unknown” in the “City of destination” field and “As per the offer” in the “User remarks” field. |
| Exemption code | **F67** – CUKTCA – R204(a) - Engineering technologists and scientific technologists This code is auto-populated from the IMP offer of employment. |
| NOC | The NOC code is auto-populated from the IMP offer of employment. |
| Intended occupation | Job title This is auto-populated from the IMP offer of employment. |
| LMIA/LMIA-exempt # | “A” number from the work permit application. This number is auto-populated from the work permit application, and it is what is used to “match” in the Portal. If the work permit application was submitted on paper, the officer must manually enter the number. |
| Employer | Business operating name |
| Duration | Principal applicant: 1 year from the date of entry |

### Refusal

If an officer is not satisfied that all the requirements of [R200](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-200.html), including the assessment under [R204(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-204.html), are met, they must record their reasons and outline the rationale underlying the decision as well as the facts and elements considered. They must also provide an explanation for the decision in a case note.

A decision is reasonable and therefore defendable when another person is able to trace the decision maker’s reasoning, without encountering fatal flaws in the overarching logic, and is satisfied that there is a line of analysis within the given reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence before it to the decision maker’s conclusion.

The officer needs to engage with the documentary evidence that was provided by the applicant. Simply stating ‘I have reviewed the submissions and I am not satisfied that R204 is met’ **is not sufficient** for the another reasonable person to understand the logic of the decision without reviewing all of the evidence again.

Refusal reasons should clearly indicate which criteria or what requirement of R200 was not met and explain how the conclusion was reached.

For assistance, officers can follow the steps in [Decision making: Standard of review and process for making a reasonable decision](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/decision-standard-review.html).

#### Refusal grounds in the GCMS

The GCMS has standard text for refusal grounds. Officers should ensure that the refusal grounds selected for the refusal letter match the reasons that they have stated in their case note.

If an officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the applicant is not able to perform the work sought, they should select the paragraph “R200(3)(a) **You were not able to demonstrate that you will be able to adequately perform the work you seek**.” Officers should ensure that they clearly indicate in their refusal notes why they are not satisfied.

Given that there is no specific refusal ground for FTA categories in GCMS for when a officer is not satisfied that the criteria has been met, **they should select the refusal ground “Other” and add a short explanation in the Comments field that they are not satisfied that section R200 or paragraph R204(a) are met.**

Length of stay
--------------

A cumulative period of no more than 12 months in any 24-month period or for the duration of the contract, whichever is less. Permits for engineering technologist or scientific technologist may be extended up to 12 months from the start of the initial work permit and must fall within the overall 24-month window permitted for these categories.

In order to apply for an extension, applicants must:

*   apply before their current status expires;
*   comply with all the conditions that were imposed on entry; and
*   be in possession of a passport or travel document that is valid for the entire period authorized for the applicant’s stay.

In order to extend a CUKTCA work permit, the employer must submit a new offer of employment.

Officers should review the suggested documentation below when reviewing the work duration requested by the employer.
