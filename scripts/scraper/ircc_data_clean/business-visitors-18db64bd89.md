Business visitors – CUKTCA [R186(a)] – Authorization to work without a work permit – International Mobility Program
===================================================================================================================

**Important:** The LMIA exemption code associated with this work permit category has changed.

Please see [**Labour market impact assessment (LMIA) exemption codes – International Mobility Program**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes.html) for the **correct codes**

In these instructions “officers” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency.

The instructions on this page should be reviewed in conjunction with:

*   [Business visitors [R186(a)]: Authorization to work without a work permit – International Mobility Program](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/business.html)
*   [Public list of Employers who have been non-compliant](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/employers-non-compliant.html)

Officers should initially assess applicants against the general [business visitor instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/business.html) for [R186(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) found in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) and related Program Delivery Instructions (PDIs). In cases where their activities are not covered by the general provisions, officers should refer to the business visitor provisions provided in [Chapter 10 - Temporary Entry and Stay of Natural Persons for Business Purposes](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/chapter_summary-resume_chapitre.aspx?lang=eng#a10:~:text=10.-,Temporary%20Entry%20and%20Stay%20Of%20Natural%20Persons%20For%20Business%20Purposes,-Overview) of the CETA to determine eligibility R186(a).

**Important:** Officers must also refer to the CETA as the Agreement on Trade Continuity between Canada and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (CUKTCA) was built upon this agreement.

Under CUKTCA, there are two categories of business visitors: short-term business visitors and business visitors for investment purposes.

-----------

To be eligible as a business visitor under the CUKTCA, a foreign national must:

*   be a citizen of the United Kingdom (UK)
*   be engaged in permissible business activities as described in [Annex 10-D](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/text-texte/10-A.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Annex%2010%2DD%20%E2%80%93%20Activities%20of%20short%20term%20business%20visitors) of the CETA
*   be engaged in permissible activities that are international in scope
*   not have intent to enter the Canadian labour market

    *   the principal place of business of the foreign national remains outside Canada

*   be compliant with existing immigration and admissibility requirements for temporary entry;
*   request entry as a business visitor at the port of entry (POE)

Border services officers at the Primary Inspection Line may make the determination that a foreign national meets the requirements for temporary entry as a business visitors, **except persons applying for entry under the after-sales service or after-lease service provision**. These foreign nationals should be referred to Immigration Secondary due to the complexity of the application and for reasons of client service and program consistency.

Restrictions on business visitor eligibility under CUKTCA
---------------------------------------------------------

Short-term business visitors cannot:

*   engage in selling a good or a service to the general public
*   receive remuneration directly or indirectly from a source in Canada
*   be engaged in the supply of a service, except as provided in [Annex 10-D](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/text-texte/10-A.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Annex%2010%2DD%20%E2%80%93%20Activities%20of%20short%20term%20business%20visitors)

Business visitors for investment purposes
-----------------------------------------

CUKTCA also includes a provision for the temporary entry of business visitors for investment purposes.

A business visitor for investment purposes is an employee in a managerial or specialist position who is responsible for setting up an enterprise but who does not engage in direct transactions with the general public and will not receive direct or indirect remuneration from a Canadian source.

### Specific eligibility requirements for after-sales or after-lease service

The following requirements apply to business visitors seeking entry under the after-sales or after-lease service provisions of CUKTCA:

*   citizen of the UK, who is employed by an enterprise established in the UK;
*   purpose of entry is to install, repair, service, or supervise these functions, or train workers to perform services;
*   work is pursuant to an original sales or lease contract and any warranty or service agreement incidental (connected) to the sale or lease of equipment or machinery (including computer software);
*   equipment or machinery (including computer software) is commercial or industrial (not for household or personal use);
*   equipment or machinery or computer software was manufactured and purchased outside Canada;
*   work is carried out during the validity of any warranty or service agreement or any extensions of same;
*   work requires specialized knowledge (which excludes hands-on building and construction work); and
*   compliance with existing immigration requirements for temporary entry.

**Note:** persons granted entry to train or to supervise training may also train or supervise workers who are doing the hands-on building and construction work. This may require demonstrating certain procedures. The demonstration must not result in the completion of an [installation](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#i1) or servicing task, or of part of such task, or in the productive operation of the equipment or machinery.

The CUKTCA**does not**relieve after-sales or after-lease service personnel, or any other business person, from the obligation to comply with municipal, regional, provincial/territorial, or other federal requirements, where applicable.

### Work that does not meet the eligibility requirements of after-sales or after-lease service

Persons whose activities or services in Canada would constitute hands-on building and construction work may **not** enter under [R186(a)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) and CUKTCA as after-sales or after-lease service.

Generally the entry of foreign tradespersons in the building and construction industry is subject to an assessment of the availability of domestic labour (an LMIA). As part of the LMIA process, Service Canada will consult with organized labour prior to making a determination.

For personnel performing the installation or servicing, entry should not be granted when performing hands-on building and construction work. The performance of these activities is not permitted, regardless of wording in sales, warranty or service agreements supporting they be completed.

**Building and construction work:**includes installing, maintaining, and repairing utility services, any part of the fabric of any building or structure, or machinery, equipment, or structures within a building.

Building and construction work includes activities normally performed by (but not limited to):

*   labourers;
*   millwrights;
*   heat and frost insulators;
*   bricklayers;
*   carpenters and joiners;
*   electrical workers;
*   operating engineers (includes heavy equipment operators);
*   elevator constructors;
*   sheet metal workers;
*   teamsters;
*   boilermakers;
*   residential, commercial, or industrial painters (including the application of all service coatings no matter how applied);
*   bridge, structural, and ornamental ironworkers;
*   plumbers and pipefitters;
*   roofers;
*   plasterers and cement masons.

Building and construction work includes work involving:

*   assembly lines;
*   conveyor belts and systems;
*   overhead cranes;
*   heating, cooling, and ventilation or exhaust systems;
*   elevators and escalators;
*   boilers and turbines; and

dismantling or demolition of commercial or industrial equipment or machinery whether on-site or in-plant.

Documentary evidence
--------------------

A business visitor under CUKTCA must provide the following documentation:

*   proof of citizenship of the United Kingdom (UK)
*   documentation to support the purpose for entry (must be a business activity listed in [Annex 10-D](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/text-texte/10-A.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Annex%2010%2DD%20%E2%80%93%20Activities%20of%20short%20term%20business%20visitors)of the CETA),
*   need to be employed by an enterprise other than a non-profit organisation, and
*   evidence that the business activity is international in scope and that the they are not attempting to enter the Canadian labour market. 
    *   the primary source of remuneration is outside Canada, and
    *   the person’s place of business remains outside Canada and the profits of the business are accumulated primarily outside Canada.

In general, an individual who is to be paid in Canada would be considered to be joining the labour market and could not be authorized to enter Canada as a business visitor. The payment of expenses incidental to the trip is allowed, as is an honorarium.

There are scenarios and country specific situations which require the need for an economic needs test and a work permit is required. Refer to the [Annex 10-D](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/text-texte/10-A.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Annex%2010%2DD%20%E2%80%93%20Activities%20of%20short%20term%20business%20visitors)of the CETA for reservations and exceptions applying in the UK for key personnel and short term business visitors.

Oral declaration as to the principal place of business and the actual place of accrual of profits can be used as documentary evidence. If further proof is requested, a letter from the employer or the representing organization is sufficient. Prior approval procedures, labour certification tests, or other similar procedures cannot be required. Every effort should be made to avoid the requirement of a visa.

### Documentary evidence for after-sales or after-lease service

Business visitors applying under the after-sales or after-lease service provision of [Annex 10-D](https://www.international.gc.ca/trade-commerce/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/agr-acc/ceta-aecg/text-texte/10-A.aspx?lang=eng#:~:text=Annex%2010%2DD%20%E2%80%93%20Activities%20of%20short%20term%20business%20visitors)of the CETA should be referred for a secondary examination when seeking entry, due to the complexity of the application and for reasons of client service and program consistency.

The following documentation is required:

*   proof of UK citizenship; and
*   copies of the original sales or lease agreement, and warranty or service agreement, including extensions, which clearly support the purpose of entry.

The warranty or service contract must be incidental to, or connected to the sale or lease of commercial or industrial equipment or machinery, including computer software.

The warranty or service agreement does not need to have the same date as the sales or lease agreement. Particularly with third party service as it may take a number of months after the sale before the company installing or servicing the machinery is identified and sub-contracted.

The initial warranty or service agreement may be extended provided that the sales or lease agreement, or initial warranty or service agreement contained a provision allowing for the extension. The after-sales or after-lease service, therefore, continues to be contracted as part of the sale or lease of the equipment or machinery, or computer software.

### Third party service

If [third party service](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/terms-definitions.html#t3) occurs, there must be clear wording in the sales or lease agreement that specifies a third party will perform the installation, warranty, or service work. Unless such wording exists, there is no evidence that the third party service is incidental to the sale or lease. However, the firm need not be named in the agreement, as it may take some time for the firm to be identified. When a third party is not named in the sales or lease agreement, business visitors may be expected to provide a letter from the seller of the equipment that identifies them as the third party referenced in the original sales or lease agreement.

When a seller or lessor located in the UK contracts the after-sales or after-lease servicing to a third party, the third party must also be established in the UK.

### Lack of Documentation

Every effort should be made to allow documentation to be provided (e.g., by fax, email or verbal explanation) from the company in Canada or the business visitor’s employer in the UK.

The requirement for documentation has been imposed in order to clearly establish that the proposed activity is incidental or connected to the sale or lease of the equipment or machinery or computer software.

A verbal statement that the business of the applicant is being carried on outside Canada can be acceptable. Alternative indications (business cards, business papers, advertising pamphlets, etc.) may be helpful.

Final decision
--------------

### Maximum length of stay for CUKTCA business visitors

In most cases, the maximum length of stay for short-term business visitors and business visitors for investment purposes is 90 days in any 6 month period, if the applicant does not qualify under R186(a).

### Visitor record

All CUKTCA business visitors may seek entry to Canada for a number of regular visits related to a specific project. These visits may take place over a period of weeks or months. In these circumstances, consideration should be given to issuing a[visitor record](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/visitor-record.html)to reduce potential referrals to immigration secondary.
