Policy objective
----------------

Establish a 2-year temporary public policy to exempt TW apprentices with a valid work permit and apprenticeship agreement from the study permit requirement. This public policy facilitates authorization for TW apprentices to study without a study permit, enabling a seamless transition between work and study periods throughout their apprenticeship.

Eligibility
-----------

To be eligible under this public policy, the TW apprentice must meet all of the following criteria at the time of the request **and** at the time of the decision.

The applicant must

1.   hold a valid work permit
2.   have a job offer in a construction occupation identified as in-shortage
3.   have an apprenticeship agreement with the employer for the work described in the job offer that has been registered with the relevant provincial or territorial apprenticeship and certification authority
4.   request consideration under this public policy

Receipt of request
------------------

TW apprentices must request consideration under this public policy by indicating “Apprenticeship 25-27” in their request using the electronic means made available on the department’s website (web form) or an alternate format provided by the department if the foreign national or their representative are unable to request consideration online.

On receipt of the request, the Client Support Centre (CSC) will send the request to the processing office.

The processing office must search for the valid work permit and associate the Organization ID (Org ID) as follows:

*   Org ID: **O2103496316752**
*   Name: Apprentice Study Permit Exempt Public Policy
*   Type: Organization
*   Sub Type: Other
*   Other Description: Public Policy

To associate an Org ID in the Global Case Management System (GCMS):

In the Application screen>Associations tab>Organizations & Entities> click New>enter Org ID > click Go > click OK

**Note**: There is no special program code for the temporary public policy on construction apprenticeships. To assist in data collection please ensure that the ORG ID is added to each application.

Documentary evidence
--------------------

The TW apprentice is responsible for providing evidence that they meet the eligibility requirements at the time of the request **and** at the time of the decision.

The following types of documentary evidence establish that the foreign national meets the eligibility requirements:

*   proof they hold a valid work permit
*   proof of a job in a construction occupation identified as in-shortage, such as a letter of offer
*   proof of their apprenticeship agreement with the employer for the work described in the job offer that is registered with the relevant provincial or territorial apprenticeship and certification authority
*   request for consideration under this public policy by self-identifying using the electronic means made available on the department’s website (web form) or an alternate format provided by the department (telephone) if the foreign national or their representative are unable to use the web form

Request assessment
------------------

Officers must be satisfied that all eligibility criteria under the public policy and regulations are met at the time of the request and at the time of the decision.

Pursuant to section 25.2 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act(IRPA), this public policy will allow eligible foreign nationals to study without a permit.

Foreign nationals who meet the conditions outlined in this policy are exempt from the following provision of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR):

*   The requirements in section R188 to be able to study in Canada without a study permit.

Foreign nationals eligible under this public policy are subject to all other applicable eligibility and admissibility requirements not exempted under this, or another, public policy.

Decision on request
-------------------

### Approval

Study permit exemptions allowed under this public policy would apply for the duration of an eligible TW apprentice’s work permit, or until this policy expires (February 26, 2027) or is revoked, whichever comes first. The officer will provide the TW apprentice with a letter of authorization to study without a permit.

*   **Example 1**: The TW apprentice is found eligible under the public policy. The TW apprentice’s work permit(WP) expires on March 15, 2027. This public policy expires on February 26, 2027. The authorization letter would expire on February 26, 2027. If the TW apprentice would like to continue studying after the authorization letter expires, they will need to apply for and receive a study permit before resuming their studies.
*   **Example 2**: The TW apprentice submits a web form request for consideration under this public policy on May 4, 2025. The TW apprentice’s WP expires on September 21, 2026. The TW apprentice is found eligible under the public policy until their WP expires on September 21, 2026. To continue working, the TW apprentice must apply for a new WP before the current one expires. Once the new WP is received, the TW apprentice may request another consideration under the public policy with the new WP.
*   **Example 3**: The TW apprentice submits a web form request for consideration on February 16, 2027. They are found eligible the same date. This means that the authorization letter would be valid for 10 days, until the temporary public policy expires on February 26, 2027.

If the officer determines that the request for consideration is eligible under the public policy, the officer must

*   enter or verify that the ORG ID is associated as follows under the Clients & Parties screen 
    *   ORG ID: **O2103496316752**
    *   Name: Apprentice Study Permit Exempt Public Policy
    *   Type: Organization
    *   Sub Type: Other
    *   Other Description: Public Policy

*   provide the TW apprentice with a letter of authorization to study without a permit
*   enter a note in the Notes tab in GCMS indicating “Exemption granted from the study permit requirement as a temporary foreign worker apprentice in the construction sector as per the 2025 public policy. Public policy approval letter issued on this date valid to Date.”

### Refusal

If the officer determines that the request for consideration does not meet the eligibility requirements under the public policy, the officer must

*   enter or verify that the ORG ID is associated as follows under the Clients & Parties screen 
    *   ORG ID: **O2103496316752**
    *   Name: Apprentice Study Permit Exempt Public Policy
    *   Type: Organization
    *   Sub Type: Other
    *   Other Description: Public Policy

*   provide the ineligible TW apprentice with the “not eligible” letter
*   enter a note in the Notes tab in GCMS indicating their rationale for their decision
