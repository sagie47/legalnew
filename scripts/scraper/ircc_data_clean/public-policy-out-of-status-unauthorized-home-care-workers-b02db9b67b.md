Public policy for out-of-status or unauthorized home care workers: Work permits and restoration of status
=========================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

Background
----------

A 5-year [temporary public policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/wp-out-of-status-home-care-workers.html) took effect on March 31, 2025, to allow out-of-status and unauthorized home care workers to restore or extend their status in Canada and obtain a work permit while their permanent residence application is processed. The public policy applies to individuals who applied for permanent residence under Stream A (Workers in Canada) of the Home Care Worker Immigration Child Care or Home Support classes and who sought exemptions under the [permanent resident public policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/pr-out-of-status-home-care-workers.html).

Accompanying family members **in Canada** who are included on the permanent residence application are also eligible to restore or extend their status, work or study in Canada, as applicable, under the [temporary public policy](https://canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/wp-out-of-status-home-care-workers.html).

Eligibility
-----------

**Note to officers:** Applicants who previously held a temporary resident permit (TRP) or accompanying family members who entered Canada by irregular means and never held temporary resident status must apply for a temporary resident permit by submitting a paper application, in order to receive temporary resident(TR) status.

### Principal foreign national

This public policy exempts foreign nationals from certain temporary residence requirements so that they can restore their status in Canada even if more than 90 days have passed since they lost their temporary resident status. It also allows them to extend their temporary resident status or obtain a work permit.

**To be eligible for the public policy,** applicants must meet all of the following public policy criteria. The applicant must

*   have an application for permanent residence(PR) under one of the Home Care Worker Immigration Pilot (HCWIP) – Workers in Canada public policy streams that has passed the [R10](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-10.html) completeness check and been put into processing; refer to [Assessing the application](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-out-of-status-unauthorized-home-care-workers.html#assessing-the-application) for more instructions 
*   be physically present in Canada when they submit the work permit, extension of TR status, or restoration of TR status application(s) [[see note](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-out-of-status-unauthorized-home-care-workers.html#note)] 
*   have legally entered Canada as a temporary resident **on or before December 16, 2021,** resided in Canada continuously since then, and had a work permit at some point during that period 
*   at the time of application, not have authorization to work and 
    *   not have temporary resident status; or
    *   be a visitor 

*   not have made a refugee claim in Canada 
*   not be subject to a removal order 

#### Open work permits

Principal applicants may be eligible to apply for an open work permit (administrative code R01). They may apply to restore their status and apply for a work permit, or they may apply for a work permit without requesting restoration if they have a valid status.

TRP holders who let their status lapse are not eligible for restoration.

#### Visitors

Principal applicants are eligible to restore their status as temporary residents (visitors) in Canada even if more than 90 days have passed since they lost their temporary resident status, or they can apply to extend their temporary resident status in Canada.

TRP holders who let their status lapse are not eligible for restoration.

### Family members in Canada

In-Canada family members can apply under the public policy to restore their temporary resident status in Canada even if more than 90 days have passed since they lost their temporary resident status. They can also apply to extend their temporary resident status or apply for an open work permit or study permit if they meet the conditions of the public policy.

**To be eligible for the public policy,** family members must

*   be included as an accompanying family member in the principal applicant’s PR application 
*   meet the definition of a “family member” in [subsection 1(3) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-1.html)
*   be physically present in Canada when they submit the work or study permit or application(s) to renew, extend or restore TR status [[see note](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-out-of-status-unauthorized-home-care-workers.html#note)] 
*   not have made a refugee claim in Canada 
*   not be subject to a removal order

#### Open work permits

All family members may be eligible to apply for an open work permit (administrative code R01). They may apply to restore their status and apply for a work permit using the same application, or they may apply for a work permit without requesting restoration if they have a valid status.

TRP holders who have a work permit are required to apply for another TRP by paper.

#### Study permits

All family members are eligible to apply for or renew their study permit. They may apply for restoration of status and a study permit in the same application, or they may apply for a study permit under the regular study permit stream without restoration if they have valid status.

Minor children can apply for a study permit under existing study permit streams, or they may study without one at the K–12 level if they are already in Canada and both parents are not visitors. Applications must be submitted online.

**Note to officers**: Principal applicants are not eligible to apply for a study permit under the public policy.

#### Visitors

All family members are eligible to restore their status as temporary residents (visitors) in Canada even if more than 90 days have passed since they lost their temporary resident status, or they can apply to extend their temporary resident status in Canada.

Documentary evidence
--------------------

For all applications facilitated by this public policy, officers should be satisfied that foreign nationals have the following documentary evidence to make an assessment.

### Principal foreign national

**Proof that PR application has been submitted and accepted into processing**

**Examples of proof:**

*   If the applicant has received an acknowledgement of receipt (AOR) from their PR application, they can provide the AOR.

**Note**: Applicants are not required to submit their AOR as proof. If the AOR is not provided by the applicant, officers must hold processing of the application until the officer can confirm in the Global Case Management System (GCMS) if the applicant passed the R10 completeness check. Refer to [Assessing the application](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/public-policy-out-of-status-unauthorized-home-care-workers.html#assessing-the-application) for more instructions on this requirement. 
*   If the applicant has not yet received an AOR, they can provide 
    *   the tracking receipt or number from a courier and proof of payment of application fees for PR applications submitted (if the application was submitted by paper); or
    *   a copy of the email confirming that the application was submitted in the online portal and proof of payment of application fees for PR applications submitted. 

**Be physically present in Canada and have continuously resided in Canada since December 16, 2021**

*   Applicants must have been authorized to enter Canada legally as **temporary residents on or before December 16, 2021,** and continuously resided in Canada since then.

**Examples of proof of an authorized entry to Canada:**

    *   Photocopies of passport pages clearly showing the stamp made by Canadian authorities on the applicant’s most recent entry to Canada. 
    *   Copies of immigration documents such as an expired work permit, visitor record or study permit. If the proof cannot be provided by the applicant, officers may check in GCMS if the applicant was issued a permit at the time of entry to Canada.

**Examples of proof of residence in Canada:**

    *   copies of a lease or rental agreement
    *   a letter from a landlord or property owner attesting to residence and specifying dates
    *   utility bills
    *   any other bills that contain the applicant’s residential address

    *   employment documents or personal services contract
    *   evidence of receipt of benefits from Canadian government programs
    *   rental agreements
    *   club memberships

**Examples of proof of physical presence:**

    *   Proof of physical presence will resemble proof of residence, but the officer needs to be satisfied that the applicant was physically present in Canada when they applied. If the applicant leaves Canada after they applied, they can still be eligible under the public policy.

**Had a work permit at some point during that period**

*   Applicants must have a copy of an expired work permit. If the proof cannot be provided by the applicant, officers may check in GCMS if the applicant was issued a work permit during that period.

**Status in Canada**

Applicants must

*   not have authorization to work and 
    *   have no legal immigration status; or 
    *   be a visitor 

*   not have made a refugee claim in Canada 
*   not be subject to a removal order 

**Proof:** Officers may verify this in GCMS

### Family members in Canada

Accompanying family members must provide the following:

*   A copy of the IMM 0008 form for the PR application in which the principal applicant listed the name of their family members. 
*   Proof of relationship (for example, a marriage certificate, Statutory Declaration of Common-Law Union [IMM 5409], birth certificate of a common child that shows both parents’ names)
*   If the family members are applying individually after the principal applicant receives approval from IRCC on their TR application(s) to be authorized to work or to stay in Canada as a visitor, the family members are instructed to include a letter in their application indicating: 
    *   the principal applicant’s work permit number (W#) or the visitor record number issued by IRCC and/or the principal applicant’s PR application number 
    *   they are applying under this public policy: [Temporary public policy to exempt home care workers who have made an application for a permanent resident visa through the Home Care Worker Immigration pilots from certain temporary residence requirements](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/wp-out-of-status-home-care-workers.html)

*   If the family members are applying with the principal applicant as a family group, they are not required to include this letter in their application. 

**Be physically present in Canada**

The officer needs to be satisfied that the applicant was physically present in Canada when they submitted any application facilitated under this public policy. If the applicant leaves Canada after they applied, they can still be eligible under the public policy.

**Status in Canada**

To be eligible for this public policy, applicants must

*   not have made a refugee claim in Canada 
*   not be subject to a removal order 

**Proof:** This requirement should be verified by the officer in GCMS

Receipt of application
----------------------

All applications must be submitted online unless the applicant is exempt under section [R9.4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/page-2.html#h-1137913) or [R9.5](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/page-2.html#h-1137913).

**Paper application**

If the applicant meets one of the exemptions under section [R9.4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-9.4.html) or [R9.5](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-9.5.html) (for example, if they require accommodations under section R9.5, including for a disability), they can submit their application in another format (paper, braille or large print) after meeting the requirement of a complete PR application as per[section R10](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-10.html).

Assessing the application
-------------------------

Processing officers must ensure that the requirements for the application are met.

### Assessing if the applicant passed the R10 completeness check on their application for permanent residence

If the officer is satisfied that the TR application met all eligibility requirements except for the requirement that the PR application has passed the R10 completeness check, the officer **must put the TR application on hold** and check regularly in GCMS to see if the AOR is issued. **The officer should not refuse an application until a decision is made on section R10.**

*   If the PR application met the requirement of section R10 and has been placed into processing, the officer **may continue processing** the TR application(s).
*   If the PR application did not meet the requirement of section R10, the TR application(s) **should be refused** for not meeting the requirement of the [temporary public policy](https://canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/public-policies/wp-out-of-status-home-care-workers.html).
*   If no PR application is submitted, the TR application should be refused. 

### Genuine relationship

As per[section R4](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-4.html), a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse or a common-law partner of a person if the marriage or common-law partnership

*   was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA),**or**
*   is not genuine.

If officers have concerns as to the genuineness of the relationship between the principal applicant and their spouse or common-law partner, they may request further documentation or information to confirm that the relationship between the dependent spouse or common-law partner and the principal foreign national is genuine and is not a relationship of convenience.

### Dependent children and working age

There is no set minimum age to be eligible for a work permit. The submission of work permit applications on behalf of minor children is at the discretion of their parent(s) or authorized guardian(s).

The “working age” varies across provincial and territorial jurisdictions and there is no minimum age specified in the IRPR or the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) for issuing a work permit.

Therefore, unless there are reasonable grounds for an officer to be satisfied that a dependent child is unable to perform the work sought or any other reasons for refusal, minors may be issued a work permit.

Please refer to the instructions on[Who qualifies as a dependent child](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/non-economic-classes/dependent-children.html#assessing_dependent_children)to confirm if an applicant meets the definition of a dependent child in relation to the principal applicant.

All foreign nationals applying for an open work permit under this public policy**are exempt**from**the open work permit holder fee**of $100, as the applicants are not applying under paragraph R201(c) and are therefore not required to pay the fee under [subsection R303.2(1)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-303.2.html). All other applicable fees must be paid.

Officers should be aware that both fees are automatically triggered in the online application tool.

To reduce refunds, applicants are instructed to pay the work permit processing fee outside the online tool and upload their receipt under Proof of Fee Exemption.**For more information on applicant instructions**, consult: [Out-of-status and unauthorized home care workers](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/caregivers/home-care-worker-immigration-pilots/child-care-home-support/eligibility/out-of-status-workers.html#toc4).

**Mandatory refunds:**For applicants who have paid the open work permit holder fee, officers must initiate a refund of the fees as per normal office procedures.

**Important:**If this fee is paid in error, it must be refunded as per the processing office’s normal refund procedures.

**Refund - Work permit application**

If the application is refused, the associated work permit processing fee and restoration fee are not refunded.
