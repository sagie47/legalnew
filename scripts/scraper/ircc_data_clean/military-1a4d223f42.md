Military personnel [R186(d)] – Authorization to work without a work permit: International Mobility Program
==========================================================================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

In these instructions “officer” refers to employees of both Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada and the Canada Border Services Agency.

In these instructions, “[designated civilian](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/countries-designated-purposes-visiting-forces-act.html)” describes personnel of the designated states who are not a members of that nation’s military, but are travelling under the [Visiting Forces Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-99-86/page-1.html?wbdisable=true) (VFA) and have been designated as a civilian component of a visiting force.

Military personnel and designated civilians coming to Canada for the purposes of the [Visiting Forces Act](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/V-2/index.html) (VFA) as staff or to attend any school or training unit are considered on active duty and are exempt from the work permit requirement [paragraph R186(d)].

**Note:** Military personnel and designated civilians should not be confused with “military attachés,” who are diplomatic agents on diplomatic missions. The accreditation of military personnel is coordinated by the Department of National Defence.

Only military personnel designated under the VFA are also exempt from the requirements of a

*   passport under [paragraph R52(2)(e)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-52.html)
*   temporary resident visa under [paragraph R190(3)(d)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-190.html) or an electronic travel authorization (eTA) as per[paragraph R7.1(3)(f)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-7.1.html)
*   medical examination under [paragraph R30(1)(d)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-30.html)

Designated civilians are not exempt from these requirements, even when travelling under military orders.

Eligibility for authority to work without a permit
--------------------------------------------------

[Paragraph 186(d)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-186.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) authorizes foreign nationals to work without a work permit if they are

*   military or designated civilian personnel in the armed forces of a country or in the [North Atlantic Treaty Organization](https://www.nato.int/) (NATO) 
    *   North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) would be included as military personnel.

*   in possession of military movement or travel orders
*   coming to Canada from[countries designated under the terms of the VFA](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/countries-designated-purposes-visiting-forces-act.html)

**Note:** NATO nations are covered by the [Status of Forces Agreement](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_17265.htm), which sets out the terms under which the armed forces of a NATO member state are allowed to operate and live within another NATO member state. Military personnel coming to Canada under NATO movement orders, including the designated civilian component, are considered included under paragraph R186(d).

Eligibility for a work permit
-----------------------------

Military members or designated civilian components entering Canada to take employment at certain facilities may be in Canada for many years. While these military members or designated civilian components are work permit exempt, **when requested**, long-term work permits may be issued to facilitate their ability to receive federal and provincial services.

To be eligible for a work permit under paragraph R204(a), administrative code T11, the military member or designated civilian component must hold

*   an acceptance letter from the DND
*   military movement or travel orders

Documentary evidence
--------------------

Officers should be satisfied that the application to enter or remain in Canada contains the following documentary evidence needed to make an assessment

*   an acceptable identity document 
    *   Although military members are exempt from the passport requirement, they are required to provide [proof of their status in their country of origin](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/document-requirements.html#exemption).

*   movement or travel orders (for example, a NATO travel order) 
    *   Officers can use the contact information in the movement or travel order if verification is needed.

In addition, for a work permit, an acceptance letter issued by the DND indicating the following is **mandatory**

*   rank
*   surname, initials
*   hosting section/organization/location
*   Canadian Armed Forces service number 
*   start and end date of the tour of duty
*   province of residence

**Important:** An offer of employment (A#) in the International Mobility Program is not required for military members and designated civilian components under military movement orders.

A service number is required on acceptance letters for military members. Designated civilians (who also require an acceptance letter from DND) can’t have a service number.

Assessment
----------

If the processing officer is satisfied that the foreign national is a member of the foreign armed forces and is travelling on orders from the armed forces or NATO, the officer may authorize them to enter Canada and issue either a visitor record for those authorized to work without a permit or, on request, a work permit.

### Visitor record

The foreign national should be documented on a visitor record when seeking entry to Canada to perform official duties under the VFA, as this makes it easier for the member to obtain federal or provincial services as needed.

The following coding should be used:

*   Case type:12
*   Special program code: VFA
*   Conditions of entry should not be imposed on VFA nationals
*   Validity to date should be the duration specified in the movement orders
*   **User remark:** Authorized to work as per paragraph R186(d)

### Work permit

Work permits are issued under the authority of paragraph R204(a).
