Temporary residents: China Transit Program
==========================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

In some cases, Chinese nationals flying between China and the United States (US) are able to transit through Canada without a Canadian visa. Chinese nationals do not need to apply under the China Transit Program (CTP) if they are in possession of both of the following:

*   a valid US visa
*   a valid passport issued by the authorities of the People’s Republic of China (not issued by Hong Kong Special Administrative Region or Macao Special Administrative Region)

They must **also** be transiting on either of the following:

*   an Air Canada flight through Montréal Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport
*   any approved carrier through 
    *   Calgary International Airport
    *   Toronto Pearson International Airport (Terminal 1 only)
    *   Vancouver International Airport
    *   Winnipeg James Armstrong Richardson International Airport

**Note:** If a passenger does not meet all the requirements, they are not eligible for the CTP and need to apply for a transit visa.
