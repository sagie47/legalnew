Who must submit to an immigration medical exam(IME)
===================================================

This section contains policy, procedures and guidance used by IRCC staff. It is posted on the department’s website as a courtesy to stakeholders.

Permanent residence applicants
------------------------------

Foreign nationals who are applying for a permanent resident visa (PRV) or applying to remain in Canada as a permanent resident, and their family members [subsection [R1(3)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-2002-227/section-1.html)], whether accompanying or not, must undergo an immigration medical examination (IME) [section [R30](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-30.html)].

Every foreign national who must submit to an IME **must hold a valid medical certificate before a final decision can be made on their application**. The certificate must indicate that their health condition is not likely to be a danger to public health or public safety and, unless [subsection 38(2)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-2.5/section-38.html) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) applies, is not reasonably expected to cause excessive demand on health or social services [subsection [R30(3)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-30.html)].

### Family members of permanent residence applicants

All family members of a foreign national who is applying for a PRV or applying to remain in Canada as a permanent resident, whether **accompanying or not**, must undergo an IME.

The exemptions are covered in [Medical exemptions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/medical-requirements/exam/medical-exemptions.html)

**Note:** Non-accompanying family members of permanent residence applicants are only required to complete one IME. They are not required to repeat the medical exam if the previous exam has expired. If the IME has expired, the responsible migration office must request a reassessment from the responsible regional medical office (RMO) to proceed with finalizing the permanent residence application.

Temporary residence applicants
------------------------------

Foreign nationals who are applying for a temporary resident visa (TRV) or applying to remain in Canada as a temporary resident may be required to undergo an IME under [subparagraph R30(1)(a)(i)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-30.html). Every foreign national who must submit to an IME **must hold a valid medical certificate before a final decision can be made on their application**. The certificate must indicate that their health condition is not likely to be a danger to public health or public safety, and unless [subsection A38(2)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-2.5/section-38.html) applies, is not reasonably expected to cause excessive demand [[R30(3)](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-30.html)].

*   [If the duration of the visit is 6 months or less](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/medical-requirements/exam/who-must-submit-immigration-medical-examination.html#less-six)

*   [Health care students who are work-permit exempt](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/medical-requirements/exam/who-must-submit-immigration-medical-examination.html#health-care-students)

### If the duration of the visit is 6 months or less

An IME is not required unless the applicant intends to work in a setting in which the protection of public health is essential. The following list provides examples of such settings. This list is not exhaustive.

*   Occupational settings that bring the applicant in close contact with people, namely
    *   workers in health care settings
    *   clinical laboratory workers
    *   patient attendants in nursing and geriatric homes
    *   medical students admitted to Canada to attend university
    *   medical electives and physicians on short-term locums
    *   workers in primary and secondary school settings and workers in child-care settings
    *   domestic workers
    *   workers who give in-home care to children, the elderly and the disabled
    *   daycare employees
    *   agricultural workers from designated countries or territories.
        *   A country or a territory is designated if there is a "Yes" in the column entitled "Immigration medical examination required" in the [designated country and territory list](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents/country-requirements.html).

### If the duration of the visit is more than 6 months

In the calculation of whether a stay will exceed 6 months, real or planned absences from Canada of less than 14 days do not affect the determination.

An IME is required for

*   applicants who are seeking to work in occupational settings in which the protection of public health is essential
    *   The following examples are not exhaustive:
        *   workers in health care settings
        *   clinical laboratory workers
        *   patient attendants in nursing and geriatric homes
        *   medical students admitted to Canada to attend university
        *   medical electives and physicians on short-term locums
        *   workers in primary and secondary school settings and workers in child-care settings
        *   domestic workers
        *   workers who give in-home care to children, the elderly and the disabled
        *   daycare employees

**Reminder:**For work in these settings, an IME is required regardless of**length of stay**.

*   persons who, in the one-year period before they seek entry to Canada or apply for a visa or permit, have spent more than 6 consecutive months in a [country](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents/country-requirements.html) for which an IME is required.
*   students (except medical and health care students) do not need an IME unless they are from a **country**that requires an IME.

### Work permit applicants under International Experience Canada(IEC)

*   All International Experience Canada (IEC) applicants, regardless of nationality, must undergo an IME if they plan to work in a [designated setting](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html), regardless of the duration of their work permit. IEC applicants must also undergo an IME if they have lived or travelled in [certain countries or territories](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents/country-requirements.html) for 6 months or more and plan to work or reside in Canada for more than 6 months.
*   Applicants planning to work in specific occupations involving close contact with vulnerable population must always undergo an [IME](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html).
*   Applicants who completed their IME must upload the eMedical “Information Sheet” provided by their panel physician (or the signed IMM 1017B for paper files) into the “Proof of Medical Examination” or “Optional Documents” slot. Applicants applying on paper must attach the document to their application.
*   To prevent applicants’ medical results from expiring before they have received an invitation to apply (ITA), they should be encouraged to wait until they receive their ITA before proceeding with an IME.
*   Applicants who require an [IME](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/medical-police/medical-exams/requirements-temporary-residents.html), but are unable to get one within the 20-day deadline, may submit proof, with their work permit application, that they have scheduled an appointment with a [panel physician approved by IRCC](https://ircc.canada.ca/pp-md/pp-list.aspx). The submission of either the _“Medical Report– Client Biodata and Summary”_ Form or the proof of a scheduled appointment will alert the processing office **that medical results must be received before a final decision can be made**.

### Health care students who are work-permit exempt

Refer to [Immigration medical examination (IME): Healthcare students who are work permit-exempt](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/work-without-permit/health-students.html).

### Other situations that require medical exams

*   Foreign nationals for whom an officer, or the Immigration Division, has reasonable grounds to believe are inadmissible under [section A38](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-38.html) (for example, persons who answer “yes” to the questions about medical problems or exposure to tuberculosis on the application form)
*   Persons who are applying for a parents and grandparents extended stay temporary resident visa ([super visa](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/parent-grandparent-super-visa.html))—regardless of the duration of the visit or whether the applicant is from a designated country
*   [Temporary residents seeking medical treatment](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/medical-requirements/exam/evaluating-temporary-resident-applications-medical-treatment.html) in Canada may need a medical examination

**Note:** A temporary resident in a life-threatening emergency going to a hospital specializing in treatment unavailable elsewhere may merit expedited case processing. For an officer to be satisfied that payment for the treatment is guaranteed and that it will not displace Canadians awaiting treatment, a medical officer should be consulted before a decision is made. Airlines carrying such individuals may need to be informed of the nature of the condition and officers should advise the temporary resident to notify the airline before travel to avoid complications during travel.

Refugee claimants
-----------------

*   Foreign nationals who claim refugee protection in Canada [[R30(1)(a)(v)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2002-227/section-30.html)].
*   Foreign nationals who are seeking to enter or remain in Canada and who may apply to the minister for protection under subsection [A112(1)](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/I-2.5/section-112.html), other than foreign nationals who have not left Canada since their claim for refugee protection or application for protection was rejected [R30(1)(a)(vi)].
*   Refugee claimants and the members of their family in Canada must **hold a valid medical certificate before** they can be permitted to work in Canada and in order to finalize the refugee application.
    *   See [Applicants with no other means of support [R206]](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/applicants-no-other-means-support-r206.html).
